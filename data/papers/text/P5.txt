Abstract  In animal studies, β-nico tinamide mono -
nucleotide (NMN) supplementation increases nicoti -
namide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) concentrations 
and improves healthspan and lifespan with great safety. 
However, it is unclear if these effects can be transferred 
to humans. This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-dependent clini -
cal trial included 80 middle-aged healthy adults being 
randomized for a 60-day clinical trial with once daily oral dosing of placebo, 300 mg, 600 mg, or 900 mg NMN. 
The primary objective was to evaluate blood NAD con -
centration with dose-dependent regimens. The second -
ary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of 
NMN supplementation, next to the evaluation of clinical 
efficacy by measuring physical performance (six-minute 
walking test), blood biological age (Aging.Ai 3.0 calcula -
tor), Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resist -
ance (HOMA-IR), and subjective general health assess -
ment [36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF-36)].

1 3Vol:. (1234567890)Statistical analysis was performed using the Per Protocol 
analysis with significant level set at p = 0.05. All 80 par -
ticipants completed the trial without trial protocol viola -
tion. Blood NAD concentrations were statistically  sig -
nificantly increased among all NMN-treated groups at 
day 30 and day 60 when compared to both placebo and 
baseline (all p ≤ 0.001). Blood NAD concentrations were 
highest in the groups taking 600 mg and 900 mg NMN. 
No safety issues, based on monitoring adverse events 
(AEs), laboratory and clinical measures, were found, and 
NMN supplementation was well tolerated. Walking dis -
tance increase during the six-minute walking test was sta -
tistically significantly higher in the 300 mg, 600 mg, and 
900 mg groups compared to placebo at both days 30 and 
60 (all p < 0.01), with longest walking distances meas -
ured in the 600 mg and 900 mg groups. The blood bio -
logical age increased significantly in the placebo group 
and stayed unchanged in all NMN-treated groups at day 
60, which resulted in a significant difference between the 
treated groups and placebo (all p < 0.05). The HOMA-
IR showed no statistically significant differences for all 
NMN-treated groups as compared to placebo at day 60. 
The change of SF-36 scores at day 30 and day 60 indi -
cated statistically significantly better health of all three 
treated groups when compared to the placebo group ( p

group at day 30. NMN supplementation increases blood 
NAD concentrations and is safe and well tolerated with 
oral dosing up to 900 mg NMN daily. Clinical efficacy 
expressed by blood NAD concentration and physical 
performance reaches highest at a dose of 600 mg daily 
oral intake. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.

Introduction
β-Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a natural 
product which exists in small quantity in most plants, 
such as edamame, broccoli, and cucumber [ 1]. It is 
also an endogenous molecule in all mammalian tis -
sues [ 2, 3]. Its biological functions are linked to the 
ability to boost nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a product of the salvage pathway in NAD bio -
synthesis in which NMN serves as a precursor [ 2, 3]. 
NAD concentration declines with age affecting mam -
malian longevity and age-related health conditions 
through its functions of energy metabolization and 
activations of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), 
Sirtuin proteins, and etc. in mammalian tissues [ 2, 4].
Many preclinical studies on NMN supplementa -
tion have been reported [ 2–4]. NMN treatment of 
Werner syndrome (WS) worms and flies with 1mM 
dosing elevated NAD concentrations 2.2 times 
higher than control and extended lifespan to 19.8 
days vs. 13.9 days in control [ 5]. NMN intervention 
to healthy wild-type 3-4-month C57BL/6N mice 
steadily increased liver NAD concentrations over 30 
min after a single oral 300 mg/kg dose, and effec -
tively mitigated age-associated physical decline and 
was well tolerated after a 12-month oral treatment 
of 100 mg/kg/day or 300 mg/kg/day [ 1]. Clinical 
benefits of NMN supplementation in mouse models 
have shown doubled running endurance on aging 
mice [ 6], restored cognition in Alzheimer’s disease 
rat model [ 7], and reversed vascular dysfunction in 
old mice [ 8]. However, human clinical trials with 
NMN are limited [ 9–17]. The first human clini -
cal trial confirmed that NMN supplementation was 
safe up to 500 mg/day and plasma concentrations of 
NAD metabolites were significantly increased, but 
the changes of plasma NAD concentration were not 
mentioned, and the trial was an open-label single 
oral dosing with only 10 healthy male participants 
[9]. The first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 
NMN supplementation revealed the increases of 
skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and signaling, and 
significant elevation of NAD concentration in periph -
eral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), but found no 
significant change in muscle NAD concentration, 
and the trial used only a fixed 250 mg/day oral dose 
with prediabetic and obese female participants [ 10]. 
Another RCT found that the NMN supplementation 
was safe, but the increase of blood NAD concentra -
tion was not statistically significant with 300 mg/day 
oral dose on 62 middle-aged healthy men and women 
for 60 days [ 11]. A similar RCT reported that oral 
300 mg/day NMN supplement was safe and signifi -
cantly improved several blood biomarkers, such as 
HbA1c and HDL-C, but has significantly reduced 
blood NAD level for the 17 postmenopausal female 
participants after an 8-week trial [ 12]. A 12-week GeroScience (2023) 45:29–43 30
1 3Vol.: (0123456789)RCT with a fixed 250 mg/day oral NMN dose on 42 
healthy older men showed that blood NAD concen -
tration was significantly elevated and NMN was well 
tolerated, but NMN supplementation produced mixed 
results on skeletal muscle strength tests [ 13]. A sepa -
rate RCT disclosed that, after intervention also with a 
fixed 250 mg/day NMN oral dose for 12 weeks on 30 
healthy males and females, blood NAD concentration 
increased significantly starting at week 4 until the 
end of treatment at week 12 and returned to original 
level 4 weeks after NMN treatment, and the NMN 
supplementation was safe and well tolerated [ 14]. 
An RCT with 1000 and 2000 mg/day oral doses of 
MIB-626, a unique microcrystalline NMN formula -
tion, on 32 overweight or obese older adults showed 
that blood NAD concentration was dose-dependently 
increased and NMN treatment was also safe and well 
tolerated, but the trial found that lower doses failed to 
significantly elevate blood NAD concentrations [ 15]. 
A 6-week RCT with healthy amateur athletes with 
300, 600, and 1200 mg/day NMN oral regimens con -
cluded that exercise plus NMN supplementation was 
significantly and dose-dependently increased aerobic 
capacity but found no impact on physical strength 
when compared to exercise alone [ 16]. Another RCT 
on the effects of the time-dependent intake (morning 
or afternoon) of NMN on sleep quality, fatigue, and 
physical performance in older adults was conducted 
with 250 mg/day NMN oral treatment for 12 weeks 
[17]. The trial found that only drowsiness and lower 
limb function in the afternoon NMN-treated group 
were significantly improved among the many trial 
end points measured. In summary, NMN supplemen -
tation was found safe and well tolerated in all the 
above disclosed human clinical trials [ 9–17]. How -
ever, only mixed results were reported on the effects 
of NMN to human NAD elevation [ 9–15] and age-
related physical decline and health conditions [ 9–13, 
16, 17]. Most of these studies used either 250 or 300 
mg/day fixed dosage [ 10–14, 17] or only recruited 
either male [ 9, 13] or female participants [ 10, 12] or 
participants with certain health conditions such as 
obese and overweight [ 10, 15]. Further clinical stud -
ies are needed to evaluate the effects of NMN sup -
plementation on healthy middle-aged adults of both 
males and females with dose-dependent oral dosing 
regimens in the 300-900 mg/day range on the effects 
of NAD concentration, safety and tolerability, and 
age-related physical decline and health conditions.Materials and methods
Study design, ethical approval, and participants
This multicenter, randomized, parallel, double-
blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-dependent clinical 
trial on NMN supplementation at daily oral doses 
of 300 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg for 60 days aimed 
to test the effect of NMN supplementation on blood 
NAD concentration (primary outcome), safety, toler -
ability, and clinical efficacy (secondary outcomes) of 
NMN supplementation.
This clinical trial was conducted in accordance 
with the ethical principles laid down by Declara -
tion of Helsinki (Taipei 2016), the principles of ICH 
Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) (1997), 
and New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019. The 
“Royal Ethics Committee, Pune, India” reviewed and 
approved the clinical trial protocol and informed con -
sent form submitted by the two principal investigators 
(PI) of this trial. The conduct of trial-related activities 
commenced after the approval from the ethics com -
mittee. The “Royal Ethics Committee, Pune, India” 
is an independent ethics committee formed as per the 
“New Drugs and the Clinical Trials Rule 2019”. The 
ethics committee is duly registered with Drugs Con -
troller General of India (DCGI) via number - ECIV45/
Indt/MII/2013/RR-19. This trial was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04823260 and Clinical Trial 
Registry - India, CTRI/2021/03/032421. The trial 
was monitored by ProRelix Services LLP, a clinical 
research organization (CRO), Pune, India.
The trial was conducted at two clinic centers: 
Lotus Healthcare and Aesthetics Clinic, and Sunad 
Ayurved (both in Pune, India), with an experienced 
principal investigator (PI) at each site. Recruitment 
was facilitated by targeted advertisement to healthy 
volunteers from the PIs’ own databases and referrals 
of other physicians at the two centers. Each volun -
teer was firstly given trial information and signed an 
informed consent form (ICF) before screening. The 
screening process entailed demographic data (name, 
sex, date of birth, age, race, height, weight) and medi -
cal history. Physical examinations including general 
and systemic examinations and vital signs (blood 
pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, systolic and dias -
tolic pressure, and body temperature), electrocardio -
gram (ECG), and X-ray of chest were performed on 
each volunteer. All volunteers were symptomatically GeroScience (2023) 45:29–43 31

Investigational product
The investigational product was food-grade 
NMN bulky powder with the brand name 
“AbinoNutra™NMN,” which was developed and 
manufactured by Aba Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, 
China) in collaboration with Abinopharm, Inc. (Con -
necticut, USA) on manufacturing process develop -
ment, quality control, and regulatory compliance. The 
two companies co-sponsored this human clinical trial. 
The NMN bulky powder was packed into capsules 
containing 150 mg NMN/capsule by Polifarma (Nan -
jing, China). Placebo was also produced by Polifarma 
as capsules of the same make, size, shape, and opaque 
white color filled with 150 mg/capsule rice flour. 
Both NMN and placebo capsules were shipped to 
the site of ProRelix Services, the CRO (Pune, India). 
The CRO did the blinding by packing the NMN or 
placebo capsules into opaque bottles that all labeled 
the same as “NMN or placebo”. Each bottle was then 
placed into a coded kit. A statistician at the CRO 
company did the randomization to evenly divide the 
80 participants into 4 groups for placebo, 300 mg, 
600 mg, and 900 mg NMN with 20 participants per 
group. The randomization code was generated and 
digitally locked in CRO’s database by the statistician. 
The statistician was the only person who was able to 
access and decode the randomization list.
Trial staff at the two clinical centers allocated 
these coded kits to participants and instructed par -
ticipants to take two capsules [300 mg NMN ( n = 
20 participants) or 300 mg placebo (7 participants)], 
four capsules [600 mg NMN ( n = 20 participants) or 
600 mg placebo (7 participants)], or six capsules [900 
mg NMN ( n = 20 participants) or 900 mg placebo (6 
participants)] a day (Fig.  1). Neither participants nor 
the trial staff were able to know which one of the two 
(NMN or placebo) was present in the bottle, thereby 
assuring double-blinding.GeroScience (2023) 45:29–43 32
1 3Vol.: (0123456789)Procedures and outcome measurements
Participants were required to visit one of the two 
clinic centers four times. The first visit was for screen -
ing of eligibility; second visit (day 0) for baseline 
assessment and randomization; third visit (day 30) 
for mid-point efficacy, safety, and dosing compliance 
assessment; and fourth visit (day 60) for end-of-trial 
efficacy, safety, and dosing compliance assessment.
At the 2nd visit (day 0, baseline), participants were 
allocated with the coded kits containing bottles of the 
investigational product for the entire trial and were 
advised to take the capsules orally with water of ambi -
ent temperature once daily before breakfast. They were 
instructed to maintain the record of dosing details in the 
participant diaries. To confirm participant’s dosing com -
pliance with the protocol, the trial staff at the two centers 
checked the number of capsules dispensed and returned 
at 3rd visit (day 30) and 4th visit (day 60) to record the 
number of capsules consumed in Case Report Form 
(CRF), and reviewed participant dairies. Treatment 
compliance was considered adequate if participants had 
used on average at least 75% and no more than 125% of 
scheduled doses.
Participants could be removed from the trial at 
any time for any of the following reasons: partici -
pant’s withdrawal of informed consent and with -
drawal by his/her own free will to not continue in the trial, participant’s non-compliance with dosing sched -
ule (75-125% non-compliance), the development of 
adverse events requiring the withdrawal of the trial, 
and pregnancy confirmed anytime during the trial. 
Reasons why subjects were discontinued from the clin -
ical trial were documented in the CRF.
Blood NAD concentration  Color imetric NAD test 
kit from MyBioSource, Inc. (catalog# MBS841786; 
California, USA) was used for the measurement of 
NAD concentration in participants’ blood samples. 
The test measures the total blood concentration of 
 NAD+ and NADH in serum. Therefore, the blood 
NAD concentration measured in our trial is the total 
concentration of “NAD+ + NADH” in the blood 
serum. Blood samples of each participant were taken 
at days 0, 30, and 60 when participants visited trial 
centers. The blood samples were then kept under 
2-8°C and immediately transported through cold 
chain to a local lab of Suburban Diagnostics (Pune, 
India) where the samples were separated into serum 
within a few hours. The serum samples were then 
stored under −80°C before the NAD test was done 
according to the commercial NAD test kit’s manual.
Safety and tolerability  Safety evaluation of NMN 
supplementation was to assess if NMN would cause 
significant changes to clinical lab parameters from 
Fig. 1  T rial flow for evaluating efficacy and safety of 
β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (AbinoNutra™NMN). Each 
recruited participant was instructed to take the assigned 
amount of either placebo or NMN orally once a day before 
breakfast with water of ambient temperature for 60 days. PO = orally, QD = once daily dosing. *Due to 1 participant each 
from placebo and 900 mg groups did not fast, Homeostasis 
Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was based 
on 19 participants for these two groupsGeroScience (2023) 45:29–43 33
1 3Vol:. (1234567890)blood and urinary samples and to adverse events (AE) 
when compared to placebo and baseline. Clinical lab 
tests of blood and urinary samples were conducted at 
baseline and day 60. The lab clinical tests at 1st visit 
for screening served as baseline. Physical examina -
tion of general and systematic exam and vital signs 
was conducted, documented, and analyzed for safety 
concern at each visit. Adverse events (AE) were also 
monitored, recorded, and analyzed for NMN supple -
mentation-related safety issues throughout the course 
of trial. Tolerability study was conducted through the 
comparison analysis of treatment vs. placebo on the 
number of dropout due to AEs.
Six‑minute walking test  The 6-minute w alking test 
was conducted by adapting the protocol issued by the 
American Thoracic Society [ 18] for measuring endur -
ance and energy level. It was conducted at days 0, 30, 
and 60. During the 6-minute walking test, participants 
were asked to walk on a manual treadmill which can 
mimic a walking field. Distance in meters was recorded 
through a digital odometer of the treadmill.
Blood biological age  The A ging.Ai 3.0 calculator 
(Insilico Medicine, Inc., Hong Kong and New York) 
[19] based on a total of 19 clinic laboratory test param -
eters [albumin, glucose (fasting), urea (BUN), total cho -
lesterol, protein total, sodium, creatine, hemoglobin, 
bilirubin total, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL 
cholesterol (by Friedewald), calcium, potassium, hema -
tocrit, MCHC, MCV, platelets, erythrocytes (RBC)] 
was applied at baseline (day 0) and day 60.
Homeostasis Model Assessment ‑ Insulin Resistance 
(HOMA‑IR) test  The HOMA -IR was assessed by 
taking blood samples from participants when fasting at 
days 0 and 60. Fasting insulin and glucose levels was 
then measured by Suburban Diagnostics (Pune, India). 
HOMA-IR index was calculated by an online HOMA2 
IR calculator at https://  www.  dtu. ox. ac. uk/ homac  alcul 
ator/ which is a licensed tool from University of Oxford 
Diabetes trial unit.
36‑Item Short Form Survey (SF‑36 Question ‑
naire)  Assess par ticipants’ overall health status or 
quality of life [ 20] was administered at days 0, 30, 
and 60. The total SF-36 score (37-152 points) of 
each participant was calculated based on participant’s 
responses and SF-36 scoring guideline.Statistical analysis  The s tatistical analysis was 
performed using the R software (version 4.1.2). 
Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. For 
baseline characteristics of participants, compari -
sons between treatment and placebo were analyzed 
by t test for age, weight, height, and BMI and by 
Chi-square t test for sex. For the efficacy analyses, 
participants without violation of trial protocol were 
included in the Per Protocol analyses. For blood 
NAD concentrations, six-minute walking test, and 
SF-36 scores that were measured at multiple times 
during the trial, mixed model for repeated meas -
ures (MMRM) was used to compare between the 
groups and paired t test was used for intragroup 
comparison. Paired t test was used for compari -
son of both intergroups and intragroups of blood 
biological age since the data were only measured 
at two time points (baseline and day 60) and fol -
lowed normal distribution. The data from HOMA-
IR did not follow normal distribution. Thus, Mann-
Whitney U test was used for intergroup comparison 
while Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for intra -
group analysis. For safety and tolerability, all par -
ticipants enrolled in the trial, who have received at 
least one dose of trial products (placebo or NMN), 
were included in the safety and tolerability analy -
sis. Adverse events were presented as summa -
ries counting both the number of separate events 
and the number of participants who experienced 
adverse events during the trial period. For clinical 
laboratory test data, paired t test was used for the 
statistical analysis on comparison of NMN supple -
mentation to baseline and placebo.
Results
Baseline characteristics of participants
A total of 84 volunteers of were screened and 80 healthy 
participants with a mean age of 49.3 (SD = 6.8) years 
(59% female) were included in the trial (Fig.  1). Recruit -
ment took place between May 25, 2021 and July 8, 2021. 
All 80 participants completed the trial without violation 
of the trial protocol and were included in the Per Proto -
col analysis except for the analysis of HOMA-IR, as two 
participants (one in the placebo and one in the 900 mg 
group) were excluded because of a non-fasting state. Par -
ticipants’ baseline characteristics are shown in Table  1. GeroScience (2023) 45:29–43 34
1 3Vol.: (0123456789)All 80 participants complied with our 75-125% trial dos -
ing protocol. The number of participants in 75-99% com -
pliance was 7, 7, 9, and 6 respectively, while the number 
of participants in 100% compliance was 13, 13, 11, and 
14 respectively in placebo, 300 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg 
NMN groups with 20 participants in each group. There 
were no participants who took over 100% scheduled 
dose. Demographic variables were found to be evenly 
distributed across the placebo and three NMN groups.
Blood NAD concentration
The NAD concentrations are given in Table  2. 
Blood NAD concentrations were found statistically 
significantly increased over baseline in all three 
NMN-treated groups at both days 30 and 60 (all p 
≤ 0.001) while there were no significant changes in 
the placebo group over the same periods. Compared 
to placebo, blood NAD concentrations were statis -
tically significantly increased for all three NMN-
treated groups at both days 30 and 60 time points 
(all p < 0.001) (Fig.  2A).Compared to the 300 mg NMN group, the 600 
mg NMN group had statistically significantly higher 
NAD concentrations at both 30-day and 60-day ( p < 
0.05 and 0.01 respectively) (Fig.  2A). No statistical 
difference was found between the 600 mg and 900 
mg group.
Safety and tolerability
The results of clinical lab tests are given in 
Table  3. Compared to the placebo group, all 
parameters of the three treated groups were not

results of MCHC and LDL at 900 mg NMN, and 
uric acid nitrogen at 600 mg NMN. There was no 
abnormality observed in clinical lab parameters of 
all participants.
Adverse events (AE) that occurred during the 
trial were summarized in Table  4. A total of nine 
AE cases were reported in seven participants. Six 
AEs were reported in five participants in placebo 
group and three AEs in two participants in 300 mg

The w alking distance of the six-minute walking 
test is given in Table  2 and Fig.  2B. Participants 
in the 600 mg and 900 mg NMN-treated group 
walked a significantly longer distance at both 
30-day and 60-day compared to baseline (all p < 
0.05), while the 300 mg NMN group showed a 
trend at day 60 ( p = 0.079). The walking perfor -
mance in the placebo group did not significantly 
change when compared to baseline (both p > 
0.05). Compared to placebo, the walking distances 
of the six-minute walking test were significantly 
longer for all three NMN-treated groups at both 
days 30 and 60 (all p < 0.01).
Participants in the 600 mg NMN-treated group 
had a statistically longer walking distance compared 
to the 300 mg NMN-treated group at days 30 and 60 
(both p < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in 
the walking distance between the 900 mg and 600 mg 
NMN-treated group (both p > 0.05).
Blood biological age
Results of the blood biological age are given in 
Table  2 and Fig.  2C. The blood biological age 
did not significantly change over time within the 
NMN-treated groups. Within the placebo group, 
the blood biological age increased significantly 
from baseline to day 60 ( p = 0.029). When com -
pared to placebo, the change of biological age 
from baseline to day 60 in the three NMN-treated 
groups showed statistically significant difference 
(all three p < 0.05).HOMA -IR index
HOMA-IR results are summarized in Table  2 and 
Fig.  2D. When compared to baseline, NMN treat -
ment did not significantly change HOMA-IR in the 
placebo and 300 mg NMN-treated group, while 
HOMA-IR increased significantly in both the 600 
mg and 900 mg groups. There was no statistical 
significance in HOMA-IR index when comparing 
the three treated groups to placebo or between the 
NMN-treated groups.
SF-36 Questionnaire scores
SF-36 scores are summarized in Table  2 and Fig.  2E. 
When compared to placebo, all three NMN-treated 
groups at day 60 ( p < 0.01) and 600 mg and 900 mg 
at day 30 ( p < 0.05 and 0.001 respectively) gave sig -
nificantly better SF-36 scores. SF-36 scores did not 
differ comparing between NMN-treated groups ( p > 
0.05). SF-36 scores did not change within the pla -
cebo group while the scores improved over baseline 
at day 60 in the 300 mg group ( p = 0.003) and both 
at days 30 and 60 in the 600 mg and 900 mg NMN-
treated groups (all p < 0.015).
Discussion
This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 
trial investigated the efficacy and safety of NMN 
supplementation with 300 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg 
daily oral doses in healthy adults of 40-65 years old. 
The primary objective was to evaluate blood NAD Table  4  A dverse event (AE) of the placebo and three NMN-treated groups

assess the safety and tolerability of NMN supplemen -
tation, next to the evaluation of clinical efficacy by 
measuring six-minute walking test, blood biological 
age (Aging.Ai 3.0 calculator), HOMA-IR, and SF-36 
scores.
In mice, oral NMN can be quickly absorbed 
through the intestine, efficiently transported into blood 
circulation, and immediately converted into NAD 
at various tissues, such as blood, liver, and skeletal 
muscle [ 2]. However, when we designed our trial in 
early 2021, it had been unclear whether and how oral 
NMN intervention can increase human NAD concen -
trations [ 2, 21]. The first published human clinical 
trials conducted in 2016 did not find that NMN sup -
plementation increased blood NAD concentration in 
healthy men; instead, it only reported the increase of 
plasma levels of NAD metabolites [ 9]. A report in 
2021 showed that a fixed 250 mg/day oral dosage of 
NMN supplementation significantly increased pre -
diabetic and obese women’s NAD concentration in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), but not 
in muscles [ 10]. A human clinical trial published in 
2022 disclosed that a 300 mg/day oral dosage of NMN 
on healthy adults elevated blood NAD concentration 
in serum (measured as the total  NAD+ and NADH in 
serum by colorimetric method) by 11.3% at day 30 
and 14.3% at day 60, but the increases were statisti -
cally insignificant [ 11]. Another human clinical trial 
report disclosed a decrease of blood serum NAD con -
centration as measured by mass spectrometry after 
NMN supplementation [ 12]. Also published in 2022, a 
human clinical trial with a fixed oral dose of 250 mg/
day NMN found that whole blood NAD and NMN 
concentrations measured by LC-MS/MS were signifi -
cantly increased on healthy male participants [ 13]. A 
similar human clinical trial of NMN with a 250 mg/
day fixed dosage on both healthy male and female 
adults was also published in 2022 and confirmed that 
NMN significantly increased whole blood NAD con -
centration, but not NMN concentration [ 14]. Finally, 
a human clinical trial published in 2022 disclosed that 
1000 mg microcrystalline NMN once daily or twice 
daily regimens on obese participants for 14 days sta -
tistically significantly and dose-dependently increased 
both NMN and NAD concentrations in whole blood as 
measured by LC-MS/MS [ 15]. As seen in the above 
reported seven human clinical trials of NMN supple -
mentation on the effect of blood NAD concentrations, the results are mixed but overall confirmed that orally 
administered NMN can be absorbed by the human 
digestive system into systemic circulation and quickly 
converted into NAD in human blood. The particle size 
and crystalline forms of NMN investigational product, 
the ways of blood sample collection, and the analyti -
cal methods of blood samples affect the results of final 
blood NAD concentrations [ 14]. Our investigational 
product was AbinoNutra™NMN, a fine crystalline 
powder, which increased blood NAD concentrations 
significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Blood NAD 
concentration was measured as the total “NAD+ + 
NADH” concentration in serum by validated commer -
cial colorimetric method.
This trial showed that NMN supplementation 
is safe and well tolerated at up to 900 mg oral daily 
doses. There were no NMN treatment-related adverse 
events and dropouts. Lab parameters and physi -
cal examination did not show significant abnormal 
changes during the 60-day NMN treatments of all 
three doses. Our safety and tolerability observations 
are consistent with results of other published human 
clinical trials [ 9–17].
It was reported that NMN supplementation in aged 
mice increased NAD concentrations and improved 
physical activity [ 1], and increased treadmill run -
ning distance significantly by activating SIRT1 in 
skeletal muscle vascular endothelial cells [ 6]. When 
compared to placebo, our six-minute walking test 
results showed an increase of distances covered dur -
ing the 6 min for all three NMN doses and the two 
time points except the 300 mg group at day 30, which 
is consistent with other published human clinical tri -
als that NMN supplementation can increase skeletal 
muscle metabolization function [ 10], muscle strength 
[13], muscle utilization of oxygen [ 16], and lower 
limb function [ 17]. However, one trial reported that 
there was no statistically significant difference in its 
six-minute walking test when compared to placebo 
[11]. Finally, the results of our six-minute walking 
test are right within the published range of 294-691 m 
of healthy Indian adults considering all our trial par -
ticipants are Indian ethnicity [ 22].
Biological age has been gaining attention including 
epigenetic clock and blood biological age [ 23, 24]. Bio -
logical age clock is used to predict a person’s lifespan 
and healthspan [ 23]. The Aging.Ai 3.0 model developed 
by Insilico Medicine was used for our blood biological 
age study [ 19]. This biological age clock, also called GeroScience (2023) 45:29–43 41
1 3Vol:. (1234567890)hematological clock or blood biological age, uses 19 
blood test parameters for calculating the blood biological 
age. Our trial found that NMN supplementation helped 
maintain the blood biological age while it increased sig -
nificantly in placebo during the 60-day trial.
One previous human clinical trial reported that 
NMN supplementation can increase the skeletal 
muscle insulin sensitivity of prediabetic and obese 
female adults [ 10]. HOMA-IR has been widely used 
for the estimation of insulin sensitivity [ 25]. Our trial 
found that NMN supplementation has no effect on 
HOMA-IR of healthy adults. Similar results were also 
reported from two other human clinical trials [ 11, 13].
Previous human clinical trials reported that NMN 
supplementation had no effect on sleep quality [ 9, 17], 
no impact on age-related phenotypes [sensory as meas -
ured by hearing improvement, vascular as evaluated by 
blood pressure and flow-mediated dilation, and cogni -
tion as assessed by using mini-mental state examination-
Japanese (MMSE-J) and Japanese version of the Mon -
treal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA-J)] [ 13], and mixed 
results on fatigue [ 17]. One previously published clinical 
trial in healthy adults reported that NMN supplementa -
tion did not generate significant improvement on SF-36 
scores as a measure for overall health [ 11]. The results 
from this trial on SF-36 assessment indicated that the 
NMN supplementation improved middle-aged adults’ 
overall health status at day 60, and higher doses and 
longer NMN treatment gave better SF-36 scores.
This trial was completed without dropout and by 
strictly following our trial protocol and GCP guide -
lines. We achieved positive results on many of our trial 
end points on efficacy and safety of NMN supplemen -
tation. However, an even higher number of participants 
and longer trial duration might have given even more 
insightful results of trial end points. Furthermore, addi -
tional biological age clocks and longer trial duration are 
needed to confirm our results. It will also be very inter -
esting to conduct a larger study to assess the impact 
of gender on many of our trial end points since males 
and females could respond differently to NMN supple -
mentation. Finally, our trial measured the total “NAD+ 
+ NADH” concentration in serum. Future studies 
directed to measure NAD concentration in whole blood 
or other tissues will help gain more comprehensive val -
ues about the impact of NMN supplementation.
In conclusion, blood NAD concentration was sig -
nificantly and dose-dependently increased during the 
NMN treatment. Oral administration of NMN up to 900 mg/day for 60 days was safe and well tolerated. NMN 
supplementation had a positive impact on the physi -
cal endurance and general health conditions of healthy 
adults as demonstrated in the significant improvement of 
six-minute walking test, blood biological age, and SF-36 
scores. The 900 mg/day oral dose did not give signifi -
cantly better efficacy than 600 mg/day dose.

Background :Healthy lifestyle has been associated with
decreased risk of coronary heart disease. In contrast, littleis known about its association with stroke risk.
Methods :This is a prospective cohort study among
37 636 women 45 years or older participating in the Wom-en’s Health Study. Stroke was self-reported and con-firmed by means of medical record review. We consid-ered the following self-reported lifestyle factors: smoking,alcohol consumption, exercise, body mass index, and diet.The health index was calculated from these variables byassigning scores from 0 to 4 to the respective variable cat-egories, with a higher score indicating healthier behav-ior. Healthy behavior was defined as never smoking, al-cohol consumption between 4 and 10.5 drinks per week,exercise 4 or more times per week, body mass index (cal-culated as weight in kilograms divided by the square ofheight in meters) less than 22, and a diet high in cerealfiber, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids, with a high ratioof polyunsaturated to saturated fat, and low in trans fat
and glycemic load.Results :During 10 years of follow-up, 450 strokes (356
ischemic, 90 hemorrhagic, and 4 undefined) were con-firmed. Compared with participants with 0 to 4 healthindex points (4.3%), women with 17 to 20 health indexpoints (4.7%) had multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios(95% confidence interval) of 0.45 (0.24-0.83; P/H11021.001 for
trend) for total stroke, 0.29 (0.14-0.63; P/H11021.001 for trend)
for ischemic stroke, and 1.27 (0.37-4.29; P=.62 for trend)
for hemorrhagic stroke.
Conclusions :In this large prospective cohort of appar-
ently healthy women, a healthy lifestyle consisting of ab-stinence from smoking, low body mass index, moderatealcohol consumption, regular exercise, and healthy diet
was associated with a significantly reduced risk of totaland ischemic stroke but not of hemorrhagic stroke. Ourfindings underscore the importance of healthy behav-iors in the prevention of stroke.

STROKE REMAINS A LEADING
cause of morbidity and mor-
tality worldwide. In theUnited States alone, approxi-mately 700 000 strokes oc-
cur each year, of which approximately 23%are fatal; an equal number of people areleft permanently disabled and in need ofassistance with activities of daily living.

Effective therapies for the treatment ofacute ischemic stroke are used uncom-monly
2and often do not completely re-
verse the impaired brain functions. Thus,identification of modifiable lifestyle fac-tors remains critical for stroke preven-tion, particularly for women who, in theUnited States, have relatively more strokesthan myocardial infarctions when com-pared with men.

The association between many indi-
vidual behavioral risk factors (includingsmoking,
3,4alcohol consumption,5exer-
cise,6,7body mass index [BMI],8,9and some
dietary factors)10,11and stroke incidence
has been studied. In contrast to findingsfor coronary heart disease12and diabetes
mellitus,13however, the combined ef-
fects of health-related behaviors on the riskof stroke and stroke subtypes have notbeen studied. We thus aimed to evaluatewhether a composite of healthy lifestylefactors reduces the risk of stroke and strokesubtypes in more than 37 000 apparentlyhealthy women.
METHODS
PARTICIPANTS
Study subjects were all participants in the
Women’s Health Study (WHS), a completedrandomized trial of low-dose aspirin and vita-min E in the primary prevention of cardiovas-cular disease and cancer. The methods and re-sults of the WHS have been described in detailpreviously.
14-16Briefly, 39 876 female health pro-
fessionals in the United States who were 45years or older at the beginning of 1993 and whodid not have a history of cardiovascular dis-ease, cancer, or other major illnesses were ran-

domly assigned to receive aspirin (100 mg on alternate days),
vitamin E (600 IU on alternate days), both active agents, or bothplacebos. Baseline information on many lifestyle variables wascollected by means of a mailed questionnaire. Twice in the firstyear and yearly thereafter, participants were sent follow-up ques-tionnaires asking about study outcomes and other informa-tion during the study period. For this analysis, we included fol-low-up information from the time of randomization throughMarch 31, 2004. As of this date, follow-up was 97.2% com-plete for morbidity and 99.4% for mortality.
HEALTH INDEX
To create a health index with components that have been pre-viously proposed,
12,13we considered self-reported lifestyle in-
formation from the baseline questionnaires, incorporating in-formation about smoking, exercise, BMI, alcohol consumption,and dietary factors.
Smoking is a strong risk factor for ischemic
3and hemor-
rhagic4stroke in women, and the risk increases with the num-
ber of cigarettes smoked. We categorized participants as neversmokers, past smokers who smoked less than 20 pack-years,past smokers who smoked 20 or more pack-years, current smok-ers who smoke fewer than 15 cigarettes per day, and currentsmokers who smoke 15 or more cigarettes per day.
Physical activity has been associated inconsistently with
risk of stroke. Findings from a recent meta-analysis
7of obser-
vational studies showed that moderately intense physical activ-ity compared with inactivity was protective for total stroke aswell as for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. We categorizedexercise on the basis of self-reported frequency of weeklystrenuous exercise as rarely or never, less than once per week,once per week, 2 to 3 times per week, or 4 or more times perweek.
Body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by the square of height in meters, has been associatedconsistently with a steady increase in risk of total and ische-mic stroke.
8,9,17Although the association between BMI and hem-
orrhagic stroke is less clear,8,9,17we decided to use the lowest
category as the healthiest group, which is similar to previousapproaches.
8,12,13,17We categorized BMI as lower than 22.0, 22.0
to 24.9, 25.0 to 29.9, 30.0 to 34.9, and 35.0 or more.
The association between alcohol consumption and risk of
stroke has been described as J-shaped, with the most benefitfor light to moderate consumption of alcohol.
5,18Study partici-
pants reported alcohol consumption as drinks per week or day.We categorized alcohol intake as never, less than 1, 1 to 3, 4 toless than 10.5, and 10.5 or more drinks per week. We assignedthe health index points for alcohol consumption favoring mod-erate drinking habits and assigned a low health index score forwomen who rarely or never drank alcohol. Reassigning the lowhealth index score to the highest alcohol consumption cat-egory did not substantially change the association between thehealth index and risk of stroke.
Women reported dietary intake on a 161-item standard-
ized food frequency questionnaire.
19Nutrient intake was cal-
culated by multiplying the reported frequency by the nutri-tional content of the indicated portion sizes. We calculatedglycemic load in a manner similar to previous approaches.
20
We adjusted each nutrient for total energy intake by usingthe residual method.
21To incorporate diet into the health
index, we considered 6 dietary factors as proposed by oth-ers
12,13and the association of each with vascular disease22-25:
cereal fiber, folate (including from supplement intake), theratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat, omega-3 fatty acids,trans fats, and glycemic load. Consumption of these dietary
components was grouped into deciles and scored from 0 to 9(inverse for trans fat and glycemic load), with 0 being least
healthy consumption. The individual scores were thensummed to a total diet score, which we categorized intoquintiles.
The overall health index was calculated by assigning scores
of 0 to 4 to each individual variable category, for which a higherpoint value indicates a healthier behavior. The health indexranged from 0 to 20. Healthiest behavior was defined as neversmoking, consumption of between 4 and less than 10.5 alco-holic drinks per week, exercise 4 or more times weekly, a BMIlower than 22, and a healthy diet (ie, high in cereal fiber, fo-late, and omega-3 fatty acids, with a high ratio of polyunsatu-rated to saturated fat, and low in trans fat and glycemic load).
The assigned point scheme per individual health behavior issummarized in
Table 1 . We a priori divided the health index
into categories of 0 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 12, 13 to 16, and 17 to 20points, reflecting the 4-point scheme that was used to createthe index. We also evaluated the association between the healthindex as a continuous term and stroke risk.
ASCERTAINMENT OF STROKE
Participants who reported a stroke on a follow-up question-naire were asked for permission to review their medical rec-ords. A diagnosis of stroke was confirmed only after review ofthe medical records by an end-points committee of physi-cians. A nonfatal stroke was defined as a focal-neurological defi-cit of sudden onset and vascular mechanism that lasted morethan 24 hours. Cases of fatal stroke were documented if theyhad evidence of cerebrovascular mechanism using informa-tion obtained from all available sources, including death cer-tificates and hospital records. Clinical information and resultsfrom brain imaging were used to distinguish among ischemic,hemorrhagic, and unknown subtype. The interobserver agree-ment of the classification of stroke and its major subtypes inthe WHS was excellent.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Of the 39 876 participants, we excluded 2237 women with in-formation missing on lifestyle factors and 3 women who re-ported a stroke before the baseline questionnaire, leaving 37 636for this analysis. We used Cox proportional hazards models toevaluate the association between the health index and the risk oftotal, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke. We calculated age- andmultivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and their correspond-ing 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the category conven-tionally believed to be least healthy as the reference group. Wedistinguished 2 multivariable models. Model 1 controlled for age(quadratic term), postmenopausal hormone use (never, past, orcurrent), past and present use of oral contraceptives, family his-tory of myocardial infarction before age 60 years, annual house-hold income ( /H11021$50 000, $50 000 to /H11021$100 000, or /H11350$100 000),
highest level of education (less than a bachelor’s degree, bach-elor’s degree, or master’s degree or doctorate), location of resi-dence (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, or West), marital status(single, married, or other), ethnicity (white, black, or other), andrandomized treatment assignments. Model 2 additionally con-trolled for the potential consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle—history of hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure of atleast 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg,or self-reported physician-diagnosed hypertension), antihyper-tensive treatment, history of diabetes mellitus, and history of cho-lesterol of 240 mg/dL (6.21 mmol/L) or higher.
We evaluated whether the association between the health
index and stroke was modified by age ( /H1102155, 55-64, or /H1135065 years)
and history of hypertension (defined as before). We tested age-

adjusted effect modification by using the likelihood ratio test.
We calculated Pfor trend across the mean values of health in-
dex categories. All analyses were performed with SAS version9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC); Pvalues are 2-tailed, and we
considered P/H11021.05 statistically significant.
RESULTS
After a mean of 10 years of follow-up (374 658 person-
years), 450 strokes (356 ischemic, 90 hemorrhagic, and4 unknown) were confirmed among the 37 636 partici-pating women. Table 1 summarizes the association be-tween health index categories and the individual com-ponents of the index. In addition, we provide theassociation between individual components and risk oftotal stroke. As expected, women with 17 or morehealth index points (4.7% of the study population)were less likely to be current smokers, exercised moreregularly, drank alcohol in moderation, had a leanBMI, and had a high diet score. We found strong asso-
ciations between smoking, as well as BMI, and risk ofstroke, whereas there was no apparent associationbetween alcohol consumption and exercise withstroke risk. The diet score was inversely associatedwith stroke risk.
In
Table 2 , we summarize the association between
various baseline characteristics and health index catego-ries. As expected, the proportion of participants who re-ported history of hypertension, antihypertensive medi-cation use, diabetes mellitus, or history of elevatedcholesterol was higher in the lower health index catego-ries. Current use of postmenopausal hormones was higherin the high health index categories, whereas the propor-tion of women with a family history of premature myo-cardial infarction was lower. Black women were morelikely to be in the low health index category. Women inthe low health index category reported lower annualhousehold income, had lower levels of education, wereTable 1.

The overall health index showed strong associations
between total and ischemic stroke but not hemorrhagicstroke (
Table 3 ). Compared with women with 0 to 4
health index points, women with 17 to 20 points had mul-tivariable-adjusted (model 1) HRs of 0.45 (95% CI, 0.24-0.83) for total, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.14-0.63) for ischemic,and 1.27 (95% CI, 0.37-4.29) for hemorrhagic stroke.There was a significant trend across the mean values ofhealth index categories for total and ischemic stroke(P/H11021.001 for both) but not for hemorrhagic stroke ( P=.62).
Additional adjustment for the potential consequences ofan unhealthy lifestyle—indicators of hypertension, dia-betes mellitus, and elevated cholesterol—attenuated theseassociations; however, there remained a statistically sig-
nificant reduction of risk for total and ischemic stroke.
When we evaluated the association between health in-
dex as a continuous term and stroke, a 1-unit increasewas associated with a 5% reduction (95% CI, −2% to −7%)for total stroke, a 6% reduction (95% CI, −3% to −9%)for ischemic stroke, and 0% (95% CI, −6% to 6%) for hem-orrhagic stroke. We found no statistically significant de-viation from linearity ( P/H11022.27 for total, ischemic, and hem-
orrhagic stroke).
The beneficial effect of healthy lifestyle was apparent
in all age groups, although the trend was not statisticallysignificant among women 65 years or older. Overall, how-ever, the association between healthy lifestyle and risk oftotal stroke was not statistically significantly modified byTable 2.

age ( P=.67). Healthy lifestyle consistently reduced the risk
of total stroke among women with hypertension ( P=.007
for trend) and among women with no history of hyper-tension ( P=.03 for trend); hypertensive state was not a sta-
tistically significant effect modifier ( P=.59 for interac-
tion). Furthermore, there was no effect modificationaccording to randomized aspirin ( P=.95 for interaction)
or vitamin E ( P=.23 for interaction) assignment.
Because some may consider an increased relative body
weight (ie, BMI) to be a consequence rather than a com-ponent of an unhealthy lifestyle, we also created anotherhealth index incorporating all lifestyle variables except BMI.This score ranged from 0 to 16 points. The association be-tween this health index and stroke showed similar butweaker associations compared with the health index in-cluding BMI. Compared with women with 0 to 4 points,women with 13 to 16 points (healthiest category) had mul-tivariable-adjusted HRs of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.37-0.92; P=.03
for trend) for total, 0.54 (95% CI, 0.31-0.92; P=.04 for
trend) for ischemic, and 0.36 (95% CI, 0.27-1.60; P=.35
for trend) for hemorrhagic stroke. Additional adjust-ments for BMI categories reduced the effect estimates andled to nonsignificant trends across health index catego-ries for all outcomes. The association between the healthindex that excluded BMI and total stroke was not statis-tically significantly modified by BMI categories.
COMMENT
In this large prospective cohort of women, a compositehealthy lifestyle involving abstinence from smoking, lowBMI, moderate alcohol consumption, regular exercise,
and a healthy diet was associated with a substantial re-duction in risk of total and ischemic stroke. These asso-ciations were apparent even after controlling for the po-tential biological mediators hypertension, diabetesmellitus, and elevated cholesterol. The association wasnot significantly modified by age or history of hyperten-sion. The association between healthy lifestyle and hem-orrhagic stroke was less clear, and the results suggesteda U-shaped association. However, the number of hem-orrhagic stroke cases was small, so the effect estimateswere imprecise.
With regard to the individual components of the health
index, we found substantial reduction of stroke risk forwomen who never smoked or were past smokers and forwomen who had lower BMI. Alcohol consumption andphysical activity were only weakly associated with riskof total stroke. Surprisingly, the diet index was in-versely related to stroke risk. The increased risk of strokeamong those with the healthier diet was apparent for is-chemic and hemorrhagic stroke (data not shown). Ex-
cluding diet from the health index did not change theassociation between the remaining health index with totaland ischemic stroke ( P/H11021.001 for trend) and showed no
significant beneficial association with hemorrhagic stroke(P=.30 for trend).
Our finding for smoking is in agreement with results
from previous studies that established smoking as an in-dependent risk factor for ischemic
3,27and hemor-
rhagic4,28,29stroke. The risk of stroke from smoking is dose
related, and there is good evidence that smoking cessa-Table 3. Relative Hazards of Total, Ischemic, and Hemorrhagic Stroke According to Health Index Categories

tion can reduce the risk of stroke,3which is supported
by our results.
Overweight and obesity have been associated consis-
tently with increased risk of total and ischemic stroke.8,9
However, the association between BMI and hemor-rhagic stroke is less clear, with a generally positive as-sociation in men
17but inconsistent associations in wom-
en,8,9which may explain in part the lack of association
between our health index and risk of hemorrhagic stroke.When we evaluated a healthy lifestyle excluding BMI, wefound similar but weaker associations with stroke riskcompared with the health index incorporating BMI.
With regard to physical activity and alcohol consump-
tion, meta-analyses of observational studies indicate a pro-tective effect of moderately intense physical activity ontotal stroke,
7a J-shaped association between alcohol con-
sumption and the risks of total and ischemic stroke,18and
a linear association between alcohol consumption andthe risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Heavy alcohol consump-tion was associated with an increased relative risk of total,ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke.
18In our data, mod-
erate alcohol consumption and vigorous physical activ-ity were not strongly associated with stroke risk.
Compared with the association between diet and coro-
nary heart disease, the association between dietary fac-tors and stroke risk is less well studied. In this study, weconsidered the main components of a previously pro-posed diet index that mostly related to coronary heartdisease.
12,13,22-25Although results from previous studies
did not indicate strong associations with components ofthe diet index and risk of stroke, such as consumptionof polyunsaturated fatty acids,
30glycemic load among
obese women,31or even inverse associations with hem-
orrhagic stroke,32our diet results were still unexpected.
Future study should address the association between di-etary factors and risk of stroke and stroke subtypes. AWestern dietary pattern may increase stroke risk, but adiet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish mayprotect against stroke.
11
Despite the numerous studies on individual lifestyle
factors and risk of stroke, evaluations of combined ef-fects of these factors are sparse. For coronary heart dis-ease, analyses from the Nurses’ Health Study showed asubstantial reduction in risk of coronary heart disease forwomen who lived healthy lifestyles.
12Women who never
smoked, had low BMI, exercised regularly, consumed al-cohol moderately, and ate a healthy diet had an ad-justed relative risk of coronary heart disease of 0.17 (95%CI, 0.07-0.41) compared with the other women in thestudy. In secondary analyses, the authors also includedtotal stroke in the outcome, yielding a relative risk of 0.25(95% CI, 0.14-0.44) for the healthy lifestyle group com-pared with the other women. The number of stroke caseswas too small, however, to provide separate estimates forstroke.
Strengths of our study include the large number of out-
come events and participants, long follow-up and highparticipation rate, detailed standardized information onmany lifestyle factors, confirmed stroke cases with highinterobserver agreement,
26and the homogeneity of the
cohort, which reduces confounding by access to medi-cal care.Several limitations should be considered when inter-
preting our findings. First, information on all lifestyle fac-tors was self-reported, so misclassification is possible.However, in a prospective study, misclassification is typi-cally considered nondifferential and therefore is ex-pected to lead to an underestimation of risk. In addi-tion, health professionals are known to report their healthstatus and lifestyle factors with reasonable accuracy.
33Sec-
ond, women who participated in the WHS were healthprofessionals and mostly white. Thus, generalizability toother populations may be limited; blacks and Hispanicshave a higher incidence of stroke,
34and lifestyle factors
may be part of the reason for this observation. Our datasupport the contention that blacks and those with lowersocioeconomic status have less healthy lifestyles. Third,despite adjustments for potential confounding factors, re-sidual confounding remains plausible because our studydesign is observational. Fourth, we did not update in-formation on lifestyle factors during follow-up becausesuch updated information was not ascertained for all fac-tors that were included in the health index. Fifth, the re-lationship between the health index and stroke is influ-enced by the weight given to each component of the index.Because we did not aim to maximize the likelihood ofobserving a significant effect, we chose to give equal weightto each health-behavior component. However, becausethe use of equal weight is an imperfect approximationof the underlying biological relationships between the dif-ferent health behaviors and stroke, future analyses shouldexamine the issue of weighting.
In conclusion, in this large prospective cohort of ap-
parently healthy women, a healthy lifestyle was associ-ated with a substantial and statistically significant reduc-tion in the risk of total and ischemic stroke with noapparent benefit in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke.Our findings show the importance of healthy behaviorsin the prevention of total and ischemic stroke.

Background &aims: Type 2 diabetes (DM) disproportionally affects African Americans. Data on the as-
sociation between egg consumption and risk of DM are sparse. We sought to examine whether egg
consumption is associated with the prevalence and incidence of DM among African Americans.Methods: We analyzed baseline data from 4568 participants of the Jackson Heart Study. Egg consump-
tion was obtained using a food frequency questionnaire designed for this population. We used gener-alized estimating equations to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios of DM and Cox regression to estimatehazard ratios of DM with corresponding 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CI).
Results: The average age was 55 ±13 years and 64% of subjects were women. The median frequency of
egg consumption was 2/week for men and 1/week for women. The prevalence of DM was 22% overall(21% of men and 23% of women). Multivariable adjusted prevalence ratio [PR (95% CI)] for DM were: 1.00
(ref), 1.14 (0.90 e1.44), 1.33 (1.04 e1.70), 1.33 (1.06 e1.68), 1.26 (0.99 e1.61), and 1.52 (1.17 e1.97) for egg
consumption of <1/month, 1 e3/month, 1/week, 2/week, 3 e4/week, and 5 þ/week, respectively, p for
linear trend 0.0024. Corresponding multivariable adjusted hazard ratios were 1.00 (ref), 0.88 (0.65 e1.19),
0.94 (0.68 e1.30), 0.91 (0.66 e1.25), 1.11 (0.81 e1.52), and 1.17 (0.81 e1.70), respectively, during a mean
follow up of 7.3 years (p for linear trend 0.22).
Conclusions: While egg consumption was positively associated with prevalent DM, prospective analysis
did not show an association of egg intake with incidence of DM among African Americans.

1. Introduction
As a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2
diabetes (DM) is a major health issue worldwide [1e3]. It is antic-
ipated that 440 million individuals will be diagnosed with DM by
2030 [2]. Global healthcare expenditures due to DM are projectedaround 490 billion dollars by 2030 [3]. The burden of DM dis-
proportionally affects African-Americans. In 2009, the risk of death
per 100,000 due to DM was 44.2 for black men (vs. 23.3 for white
men) and 35.9 for black women (vs. 15.7 for white women) [4].
Previous research has identi ﬁed modi ﬁable lifestyle factors such
as diet and physical activity as important determinants of DM [5].
However, the association between different macronutrients andrisk of DM is not consistent. For example, among saturated fatty
acids, while short-chain saturated fatty acids have been associated
with a higher risk of DM, odds chain and long-chain saturated fatty
acids have been related with a lower risk of DM [6e8]. In addition,
the EPIC cohort reported that animal but not vegetable proteins*Corresponding author. Division of Aging, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 1620

were associated with a higher risk of DM [9]whereas a meta-
analysis of three studies showed no association of animal pro-
teins with DM [10].
Among individual foods, eggs could play a unique role among
dietary factors affecting the risk of DM, partly because they are rich
in proteins, cholesterol, and other nutrients. Current data on the
association of eggs with DM have been inconsistent, ranging from
no association in Japanese [11] and non-Hispanic white adults
[12,13] to a higher risk of DM with frequent intake of eggs in Chinese
[14] and other populations [15e18]. In two previous meta-analyses,
the highest category of egg consumption was associated with a42%e 68% higher risk of DM [19,20] ; however most of those data
were derived from non-Hispanic whites, and it is unclear whetheregg consumption is associated with a higher risk of DM in African
Americans. Thus, the current paper sought to examine the associ-
ation of egg consumption with prevalent and incident DM among
African American participants of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS).
2. Methods2.1. Study population
The present analysis used JHS data collected during the baseline
examination (2000 e2004). Detailed description of the JHS has
been previously published [21e25]. Of the 5301 JHS participants
who completed a baseline clinic examination, we excluded 248
who had missing data on egg consumption; one person with type 1
DM; 16 with restricted informed consent; 422 with energy intake
outside of normal ranges (600 e4000 kilocalories per day); and 46
with missing information on DM status. Thus, current analyses arebased on 4568 individuals with complete data for cross-sectional
analyses and 3564 subjects for prospective analyses after exclu-
sion of prevalent DM (n ¼1004). Each participant gave written
informed consent and the study protocol was approved by theinstitutional review boards of all institutions involved.
2.2. Assessment of egg consumption
Egg consumption was assessed using a 158-item food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) [26] that has been validated in this cohort [27].
Participants reported their frequency of egg consumption,
including fried and scrambled eggs, as never; less than once per
month; 1/month; 2 e3/month; 1/week; 2/week; 3 e4/week; 5 e6/
week; 1/day; or 2/day. Adjacent categories were combined into <1/
month; 1 e3/month; 1/week; 2/week; 3 e4/week; and 5 þ/week to
allow for stable estimate in current analyses.
2.3. Ascertainment of DM
Prevalent DM was de ﬁned as fasting glucose /C21126 mg/dL, he-
moglobin A1C /C216.5%, or current use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic
agents at baseline. Similar criteria were used to de ﬁne incident DM
during follow up among participants that were free of DM at
baseline. Since we did not have information on the exact date of
diagnosis of DM, we assigned the JHS visit date following the initial
diagnosis of DM as date of DM occurrence.
2.4. Other variables
Assays and procedures for measuring fasting whole blood,
plasma, and
serum-derived measurements in the JHS have been
previously described [21]. At JHS visit 1, we collected information
on demographic and anthropometric variables, cigarette smoking,
physical activity, education, alcohol consumption, history of hy-
pertension, CVD, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and diet.Intakes of fruit and vegetables, red meat, ﬁsh, trans fat, total energy,
dietary ﬁber, and dietary magnesium were used as covariates.
Physical activity was measured as a sum of four index scores (active
living, work/occupational, home life, and sports) [28].
2.5. Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics within each category of egg consump-
tion are presented as mean ±standard deviation (SD) for contin-
uous variables with Gaussian distribution (otherwise median with
inter-quartile range), and proportions for categorical variables. We
used generalized estimating equations to calculate prevalence ratio
(PR) for cross-sectional analyses and Cox proportional hazard
model for prospective analyses along with corresponding 95%
conﬁdence limits. Person-time of follow-up was computed from
baseline until the ﬁrst occurrence of incident diabetes, death, or last
contact. We built sequential models based on a priori knowledge. In
model 1, we adjusted for age ( /C2045,<45e55,<55e65,<65) and sex.
Model 2 was additionally adjusted for BMI ( <25, 25 e<30, 30 e<35,
35þ), smoking status (never, former, current), alcohol intake in the
past 12 months (yes/no), physical activity score (tertiles), and ed-
ucation (less than high school/high school or some college/associ-
ates degree or higher). The ﬁnal model adjusted for variables in
model 2 plus energy intake (tertiles), red meat (tertiles), dietaryﬁber (tertiles), dietary magnesium (tertiles), fruit and vegetable
intake (tertiles), dietary trans fat (tertiles), waist circumference(tertiles), history of hypertension (yes/no), and history of CVD (yes/
no). We obtained a p-value for linear trend by including an ordinal
variable that was assigned to frequency of egg consumption in the
regression model. Cox proportional hazard model assumption were
tested using product term of egg frequency and log-transformed
person-time and were met (all p >0.05).
In secondary analyses, we strati ﬁed the main analysis by sex,
BMI, and age and also examined whether egg consumption was
associated with baseline measures of insulin resistance and A1C by
computing least squares means for logarithmic-transformed A1C,
homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and
homeostatic model assessment-beta cell function (HOMA-B). Log-
transformation was necessary due to non-Gaussian distribution of
HOMA and A1C measures. All analyses were completed using Sta-
tistical Analysis Systems, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North
Carolina) with alpha level of 0.05.
3. Results
Baseline characteristics of the 4568 African Americans (Table 1 )
show a mean age of 55 ±13 years (range 21 e95), with 64% women.
The prevalence of DM was 22% (21% of men and 23% of women).
Compared to egg consumption of <once per month, higher egg
consumption was associated with male sex, current smoking, lowereducational attainment,
alcohol consumption, higher waist
circumference, lower HDL, and consumption of red meat, ﬁsh, ba-
con, saturated and trans fats (Table 1 ). Egg consumption was
correlated with saturated fat (Spearman r ¼0.37), energy intake
(r¼0.32), trans fatty acids (r ¼0.25), processed meats (r ¼0.21),
dietary magnesium (r ¼0.18), and ﬁber (r ¼0.13).
3.1. Cross-sectional analyses (eggs with prevalent DM and
biomarkers)
In a model adjusting for age and sex, prevalence ratios (95% CI)
for DM were 1.00 (ref), 1.06 (0.85 e1.32), 1.28 (1.02 e1.60), 1.29
(1.05 e1.60), 1.25 (1.00 e1.56), and 1.54 (1.22 e1.94) from the lowest
to highest categories of egg consumption (p for linear trend 0.0001,Table 2 ). These ﬁndings persisted and were not substantially alteredL. Djouss /C19e et al. / Clinical Nutrition 35 (2016) 679 e684 680
after additional adjustment for smoking status, alcohol consump-
tion, BMI, physical activity score, education, energy intake, intake of
red meat and fruit and vegetables, trans fat, dietary magnesium,
andﬁber, and history of hypertension and CVD ( Table 2 ).
In secondary analysis, we observed similar egg-DM associations
in men (p-trend 0.05) and women (p-trend 0.02), Table 3 . Neither
sex (p-interaction 0.53), nor age (p-interaction 0.88) or BMI (p-interaction 0.20) modi ﬁed the association of egg consumption with
prevalent DM. Lastly, egg consumption was not associated withmean A1C, HOMA-IR, or HOMA-B in multivariable adjusted models
with a subsample of 3178 participants without DM ( Table 4 ).
3.2. Prospective analyses (eggs and incidence of DM)
During a mean follow up of 7.3 years, 531 new cases of DM
occurred among 3564 subjects free of DM at baseline. In both crudeTable 1

4. Discussion
In this large cohort, we found a positive and linear relation be-
tween frequency of egg consumption and baseline prevalence ofDM in African Americans. However, no association was observed
between frequency of egg consumption and incidence rate of DM in
this cohort. In a secondary cross-sectional analysis, we found no
evidence for an association of egg consumption with A1C concen-
tration or with measures of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR and
HOMA-B) in participants without DM at baseline.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to examine the relation
of egg consumption with prevalent and incident DM in a large
cohort of African Americans. Contrary to our cross-sectional results,
we did not ﬁnd evidence for an association between frequency of
egg consumption and the incidence of DM during a mean follow upof seven years in this cohort. A lack of an association between egg
consumption and incidence of DM is consistent with results from
the Cardiovascular Health Study, where egg consumption was not
associated with incidence of DM among older US adults who were
predominantly Caucasians [13]. Similarly, neither a large Japanese
cohort of 63,466 adult men and women [11] nor a Mediterranean
cohort of 15,956 adult men and women [12] found an association of
egg consumption with DM with comparable follow up times.Nevertheless, our prospective ﬁndings are contrary to the health
professional data showing a positive relation between egg con-sumption and incident DM [15]. A case-control study in a Lithua-
nian out-patient clinic reported a three-fold increased odds of DMcomparing /C215 eggs/week to <1 egg/week [17]. Furthermore, aprospective study of about 3000 women reported positive and
graded relation of egg consumption with gestational DM (P for
trend ¼0.008)] [16]. A cross-sectional analysis of Chinese adults
showed a two-fold higher odds of DM comparing 1 þeggs/d to <2
eggs/week (OR ¼2.28 (1.14 e4.54)] [14],ﬁnding that is consistent
with our cross-sectional results. In a meta-analysis using prospec-tive data from the Physicians' Health Study, the Women's Health
Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), and the Adventist
Health Studies, the highest category of egg consumption was
associated with 42% higher risk of DM (95% CI: 9 e86%) when
compared to the lowest category [19]. Another meta-analysis,
which included studies in China and Lithuania, also found a posi-
tive relation of egg consumption with risk of DM [pooled RR: 1.68
(95% CI: 1.41 e2.00)] [20]. Of note is that above meta-analyses did
not include large recent studies with negative ﬁndings (i.e., the
Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study with more
than 63,000 people).
Several factors could account for the inconsistency of these
ﬁndings with our results. First, differences in overall dietary habits
(i.e., adherence to Mediterranean diet known to lower DM risk [29])
betw een
cohorts reporting positive versus no association could
partially explain the inconsistency, where the effect of a single food
item such as eggs, may be insigniﬁ cant when compared to the ef-
fects of an overall healthy dietary pattern. Second, differences inother lifestyle factors that are inherently associated with ethnic
groups or geographic locations might account for some of the
disparities. In the current study, we did not assign a high weight to
cross-sectional results in the presence of prospective data since we
cannot ascertain temporality in cross-sectional analyses. It is
possible that subjects diagnosed with DM altered their diet
voluntarily or per clinicians' advice to obtain their proteins from
eggs rather than red or processed meats. Such a scenario could
partially explain the positive relation observed between egg con-
sumption and prevalent DM in our cohort.
Eggs are a good source of protein and other nutrients. However,
a medium egg also contains up to 200 mg of dietary cholesterol
[30]. Qiu et al. [16] reported a positive association between dietary
cholesterol intake and risk of gestational DM. However, our groupreported no evidence of association between dietary cholesterol
and incident DM in older adults. In addition, a Japanese study [11]
reported an inverse relation of dietary cholesterol with DM risk[OR¼0$68 (95% CI 0 $49e0$94), comparing the fourth to the ﬁrst
quartile of dietary cholesterol]. A human study found that 12 weeksof a high-protein diet with eggs improved fasting blood glucose
(/C00.5 mmol/l) [31]. Taken together, current data do not lend sup-
port to the hypothesis that dietary cholesterol is a major culprit forthe development of DM. Could choline metabolites help explain
positive results of egg-DM association?Table 4

Eggs are an important source of choline [32], which can be
metabolized by gut bacteria to generate trimelthylamine, that can
further be transformed to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in the
liver [33]. Tang et al. [34] reported a positive association of egg
consumption and TMAO concentration. In a randomized controlledtrial of six volunteers, higher egg yolk intake led to a graded in-
crease in plasma and urine TMAO [32]. TMAO may increase LDL
oxidation and promote in ﬂammation [35], a key component of the
pathogenesis of DM [36]. A targeted metabolomic approach sug-
gested that diacyl-phosphatidylcholines C32:1, C36:1, C38:3, andC40:5 were independently associated with higher risk of DM in the
EPIC Postdam cohort [37]. However, prospective data relating
plasma TMAO concentration with incident DM are lacking. Inparticular, we did not have information on TMAO in our cohort to
further explore this hypothesis. We should note that other sources
of TMAO or TMAO precursors like seafood [38] could confound any
egg-disease relation. In a pilot study testing 46 various foods, ﬁsh
intake but not eggs or other food items led to higher urinary TMAO
excretion [38]. This study further weakens the hypothesis of eggs-
TMAO-DM risk. A lack of association between egg consumption andA1c, fasting glucose or insulin in our data is consistent with datafrom an egg feeding trial showing no effect of egg on fasting glucose
in overweight men [18].
Limitations of our study include self-reported information on
egg consumption and a lack of information on the size of eggs
consumed, type of egg preparation, quantity of yolks consumed per
egg; and on mixed dishes containing eggs. As observational study,
we cannot exclude unmeasured confounding in our data. The use of
an all-African American cohort limits the generalizability of our
ﬁndings. However, this concern is offset by previously reported null
ﬁndings in other ethnic groups. On the other hand, strengths of our
study include a large sample size, availability of data on several
important covariates, and use of standardized procedures to collect
data in this cohort.
In conclusion, our data do not lend support for a higher inci-
dence rate of DM with frequency of egg consumption despite a
positive relation of egg consumption with prevalent DM in the JHS
cohort.

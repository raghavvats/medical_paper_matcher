Abstract
Purpose This study’s primary aim was to investigate whether including a mental health component to healthy lifestyle 
interventions are associated with greater effects on quality of life (QoL) for post-treatment cancer survivors than addressing 
physical activity and/or nutrition alone.
Methods PsycINFO, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, and Google Scholar were searched to identify randomised control trials of 
healthy lifestyle interventions for post-treatment cancer survivors, with a usual care or waitlist control, and measured QoL. 
Meta-analyses quantified the effects of interventions vs controls at post-treatment on total QoL, physical, emotional, and 
social well-being. Subgroup analyses compared interventions with vs without a mental health component, modes of delivery, 
and duration. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.
Results Eighty-eight papers evaluating 110 interventions were included: 66 effect sizes were extracted for meta-analysis, 
and 22 papers were narratively synthesised. The pooled effect size demonstrated a small, significant effect of healthy lifestyle 
interventions in comparison to control for all QoL outcomes (total g  = 0.32, p  >.001; physical g  = 0.19, p  = 0.05; emotional 
g = 0.20, p >.001; social g = 0.18, p = 0.01). There was no significant difference between interventions with vs without a 
mental health component. Face-to-face delivered interventions were associated with greater total QoL and physical well-
being compared to other modalities. Interventions delivered ≤12 weeks were associated with greater physical well-being than 
those delivered ≥13 weeks. Overall, studies had substantial levels of heterogeneity and 55.9% demonstrated high risk of bias.
Conclusions Participating in a healthy lifestyle intervention following cancer treatment improves QoL. Few trials addressed 
mental health or evaluated online or telephone modalities; future research should develop and evaluate interventions that 
utilise these features.
Implications for Cancer Survivors Brief healthy lifestyle interventions can be recommended for cancer survivors, particularly 
those interested in improving physical well-being.

Introduction
Advances in earlier detection and diagnosis, improved treat-
ment options, and better supportive care are contributing 
to the growing cancer survivor population [1 ]. However, the physical (e.g. fatigue, pain, nausea, and changes in 
appearance) and psychosocial (e.g. psychological distress, 
challenges in relationships, financial stress, and changes in 
cognitive and sexual functioning) side effects of a cancer 
diagnosis and its associated treatments can significantly 
impact an individual’s quality of life (QoL) long after they 
have completed treatment [2 –4]. QoL for cancer survivors 
is a subjective multi-dimensional concept that encompasses 
and measures various aspects of a person’s physical, emo-
tional, social, and spiritual well-being, and functional status. 
QoL refers to how a person perceives their life in the context 
of their health and personal values, and how well they can 
function and participate in activities that are important to 
them [5 –7]. * Morgan Leske

 Journal of Cancer Survivorship
Healthy lifestyle interventions addressing physical activ -
ity, nutrition, and/or weight management have been posited 
as one strategy to improve QoL and support cancer survivors 
following the completion of treatment. Such interventions 
have demonstrated efficacy in (a) reducing treatment-related 
side effects, cancer recurrence and mortality [8 ], and (b) 
improving emotional well-being [9 ]. Several meta-analyses 
have evaluated the efficacy of healthy lifestyle interventions 
in enhancing QoL in cancer survivors, but their results have 
been inconsistent. Small to moderate positive effects on 
QoL have been demonstrated across meta-analyses involv -
ing physical activity interventions involving all cancer types 
[7] and breast cancer survivors [9 –11]. Similarly, healthy 
lifestyle education programs have demonstrated a moderate 
positive effect on lung cancer survivors QoL [12]. In con-
trast, meta-analyses which have investigated healthy lifestyle 
interventions for gynaecological cancers [13] or have only 
involved nutritional therapy [14] have not demonstrated sig-
nificant differences to usual care control groups. Two meta-
analyses investigating telehealth interventions [15, 16], such 
as those delivered via telephone, or videoconferencing and 
online platforms, have produced contrasting findings. Lar -
son and colleagues [ 15] conducted a meta-analysis involving 
eleven studies and initially obtained a large positive effect; 
however, the magnitude of the effect was decreased to non-
significant when two large studies contributing to heteroge -
neity were removed. In comparison, the second, and larger, 
meta-analysis by Li and colleagues [16] involving 28 studies 
found a small positive effect for telehealth interventions on 
cancer survivors’ QoL.
Although these meta-analyses support the implementa-
tion of healthy lifestyle interventions following cancer treat-
ment, they have primarily focused on interventions which 
target physical health behaviours, such as physical activity 
and diet quality. However, a qualitative study conducted by 
Grant and colleagues [17] with cancer survivors, oncology 
healthcare professionals, and representatives from cancer 
support organisations identified that a healthy lifestyle after 
cancer treatment includes both physical health and mental 
health. The participants of this study recommended that a 
mental health component be included in healthy lifestyle 
interventions. Addressing mental health within healthy life -
style interventions is also promoted by research investigating 
barriers to physical activity and healthy eating, which have 
identified stress as a prevalent barrier to engaging in these 
health behaviours [18, 19]. 
Thus, interventions targeting a healthy lifestyle after can-
cer treatment should go beyond physical activity and nutri-
tion and address mental health as well. To date, meta-anal-
yses have not examined whether interventions that include 
a mental health component increase the impact of healthy 
lifestyle interventions on cancer survivors’ QoL. The cur -
rent meta-analysis aims to update the previous evidence for the efficacy of healthy lifestyle interventions on QoL post-
intervention and to investigate whether interventions which 
include a mental health component in their intervention 
protocol are associated with greater effects on QoL in com-
parison to interventions which only address physical activity 
or nutrition. The secondary aim of this meta-analysis is to 
investigate whether other aspects of the intervention, such 
as mode of delivery (individual, group, telephone, online, or 
print) or duration (shorter vs longer), affect the association 
between the interventions and QoL.
Method
This meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) state-
ment [20] and was prospectively registered on PROSPERO 
(CRD42021273722).
Study selection
To identify relevant studies, a review of electronic databases 
relevant to psychology and health, including PsycINFO, 
Scopus, Medline, and CINAHL, was conducted. In addition, 
the first 200 references identified in Google scholar were 
included in the review. The search strategy was based on 
the PICO approach, as follows: population—terms related 
to (1) cancer, and (2) survivor; intervention—terms related 
to (1) healthy lifestyle, (2) physical activity, (3) nutrition, 
and (4) weight control; outcome—terms related to QoL (see 
Multimedia A for details). The final database search was 
conducted on the 9th of June 2022.
Articles were included in the analysis if they meet the 
following criteria: (1) involved adult cancer survivors (i.e. 
≥18 years and have completed active treatment); (2) offered 
an intervention targeting health behaviour change (i.e. physi-
cal activity, sedentary time, or diet, or weight management); 
(3) reported an outcome measure for total QoL, and/or 
Physical, Emotional, or Social Well-being on a reliable and 
valid measure of QoL (e.g. European Organization for the 
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Question-
naire (EORTC QLQ-C30; [6 ]), Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G; [5 ]), or 36- or 12-Item 
Short Form Health Survey (SF-36; [21], SF-12; [22]); (4) 
involved a randomised control trial or pilot randomised con-
trol trial using a waitlist or usual care control (i.e. access 
to publicly available materials); (5) written in English and 
published in a peer-reviewed journal. Included articles 
investigated interventions utilising any mode of delivery. 
Articles were excluded if they involved a population other 
than adult cancer survivors, did not offer an intervention 
targeting health behaviour change, offered an intervention 
which only targeted mental health, did not measure QoL, or 
Journal of Cancer Survivorship 
utilised any of the following designs: crossover design, sin-
gle group pre-post, qualitative, cross-sectional design, proto-
col paper, systematic review, or meta-analysis. Articles were 
also excluded if they were grey literature (e.g. dissertations 
or conference papers).
Authors ML and CG conducted preliminary screening 
of titles and abstracts. Abstracts meeting inclusion criteria 
were subject to full-text evaluation. Disagreement between 
the two reviewers were resolved through discussion. If con-
sensus was not achieved, a third author (LB) was consulted.
Data extraction
Data extracted from articles that met inclusion criteria 
included study characteristics (e.g. author, year of publica-
tion, country intervention was delivered), participant charac-
teristics (e.g. gender, age, cancer type, and time since diag-
nosis), intervention characteristics (i.e. duration, mode of 
delivery, and behaviours targeted), and outcome measures. 
Interventions were categorised as addressing physical activ -
ity if they targeted bodily movement and included increas-
ing exercise (i.e. planned, structured, and repetitive move-
ments to increase physical fitness), leisure time activity, and 
reducing sedentary time. Interventions were categorised as 
addressing nutrition if they targeted the increase and/or 
decrease of certain foods or nutrients. Interventions were 
categorised as including a mental health component if they 
provided a manualised psychological treatment, psycho-edu-
cation material on mental health and well-being, or counsel -
ling with the intention of addressing emotional distress. To 
calculate effect sizes between the intervention and control 
groups, the post-intervention sample size, means, and stand-
ard deviations for total QoL were extracted. As several QoL 
measures do not quantify a total score, the means and stand-
ard deviations of subscales relevant for physical, emotional, 
and social well-being in both the intervention and control 
groups were also extracted. These subscales were selected 
as they were present in all valid QoL scales. For inter-rater 
reliability, two authors (ML and CG) undertook data extrac-
tion on a subset of articles (n  = 58).
Quality assessment
The risk of bias of each study was evaluated by one author 
(ML) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2.0 (RoB 2; 
[23]). This tool evaluates the risk of bias in five domains: 
(1) the randomisation process, (2) deviations from intended 
interventions, (3) missing outcome data, (4) measurement 
of outcome, and (5) selection of the reported result. As the 
current meta-analysis was summarising self-reported QoL, 
domain 4: measurement of outcome, was not considered 
in the evaluation of risk. Using this tool, the articles were 
evaluated and judged on the domains as being either low risk of bias, some concerns, or high risk of bias. For overall bias, 
articles were considered to have low risk of bias if they were 
rated as low risk of bias on each of the domains and high 
risk of bias if they were rated as having high risk of bias on 
at least one of the domains or as having some concerns on 
at least two of the domains.
Data analysis
The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis computer package [24] 
was used for all analyses. Standardised mean differences 
(Hedge’s g) between the intervention and control groups 
with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the total 
QoL and each of the QoL subscales. Effect sizes were pooled 
using a random effects model to derive the overall effect size 
of healthy lifestyle interventions on QoL for cancer survi-
vors. Following this, three pre-specified subgroup analyses 
were conducted to investigate whether the efficacy of healthy 
lifestyle interventions on QoL was influenced by selected 
intervention components. The first subgroup analysis inter -
ventions were categorised based on the inclusion of a mental 
health component. The second sub-group analysis separated 
interventions based on their dominant mode of delivery, such 
as individual face-to-face, groups, telehealth, digital health, 
or print. As there were interventions where one delivery was 
not dominant, a multiple category was included. The final 
pre-specified sub-group analysis investigated interventions 
which had a shorter duration (i.e. 12 weeks or less) or a 
longer duration (i.e. 13 weeks or more). Narrative synthesis 
was used to summarise findings in studies which could not 
be included in the meta-analysis. The narrative synthesis 
focused on the efficacy of the healthy lifestyle intervention 
in comparison to the usual care control and the potential 
impact the intervention characteristics of the inclusion of a 
mental health component, the mode of intervention delivery, 
and intervention duration.
Heterogeneity and publication bias
The heterogeneity of the data was assessed using Q  (pres-
ence of heterogeneity) and I2 (proportion of total variation 
between studies that results from heterogeneity) statistics 
[25]. The I2 scale ranges from 0% (no heterogeneity) to 
100% (high heterogeneity). Cochrane’s guide to interpreta-
tion of the I2 statistic specifies that 0–40% = heterogeneity 
that might not be important, 30–60% = moderate heteroge-
neity, 50–90% = substantial heterogeneity, and 75–100% 
= considerable heterogeneity. To interpret the I2 statistic, 
the number of studies included magnitude and direction 
of the effect, and Q  statistic was taken into consideration. 
Sources of heterogeneity were explored by conducting post 
hoc sub-group analyses [26], by dividing studies into two or 
more subgroups and calculating the Q  and I2 statistics for 
 Journal of Cancer Survivorship
each subgroup. Three subgroups were explored: (1) multi-
component (i.e. targeting more than one health behaviour) vs 
single component (i.e. targeting a single health behaviour); 
(2) measure of QoL; (3) QoL measured as the primary vs 
secondary outcome. For the second subgroup analysis, the 
measures of QoL were grouped under their measurement 
system, rather than individual measures, to ensure relatively 
equal groups. For example, those who included the FACT-
Breast, FACT-Colorectal, and FACT-General were grouped 
under FACT and the SF12 and SF-36 were grouped under 
SF.
Publication bias was evaluated by Egger’s regression 
intercept, which examines the correlation between effect 
sizes and standard errors of effect sizes. If there is a signifi-
cant association between study effect size and study preci-
sion, this indicates the possibility of publication bias. Each 
QoL outcome was considered separately.
Results
Study selection
Figure  1 presents the PRISMA flow diagram of the study 
selection process. Following screening, 88 articles involv -
ing 110 interventions met inclusion criteria for the system-
atic review, and 66 articles met criteria for meta-analysis. 
Articles were most commonly excluded due to the use of 
an active control (e.g. workbook or telephone calls). The 
predominant reason for excluding articles from the meta-
analysis was reporting change over time instead of post treat-
ment means and standard deviations. The agreement rate 
between reviewers was 91.5% for title and abstract screen-
ing, 77.4% for full text review, and 66% for data extraction. 
Exacting different total scores for QoL when multiple scales 
were reported (e.g. SF-36 and FACT-G) accounted for 73% 
of the differences in the data extraction. In all instances of 
disagreement, consensus was reached through discussion.
Study characteristics
Multimedia B summarises the 88 included studies. The total 
number of participants included in this review was 9556, 
with sample sizes ranging from 14 to 641 and a median of 
71. There was an over-representation of females in included 
studies with 51 interventions offered only to breast cancer 
survivors. The average age of included participants was 
57.93 (SD = 11.32) years. Forty-eight studies reported time 
since diagnosis, of which the median was 23.53 months 
(range = 6.40–87.6 months). The majority of included stud -
ies were conducted in the USA (n  = 27), Canada (n  = 11), 
Australia (n  = 9), Spain (n  = 6), Netherlands (n  = 6), and 
the UK (n  = 5). In terms of study design, 30.7% studies measured QoL as their primary outcome. The most common 
QoL measures were the FACT (n  = 33), EORTC QLQC30 
(n = 25), and the SF questionnaire (n  = 23).
Intervention characteristics
Mode of delivery
A diverse range of delivery modalities were investigated in 
the included interventions. Most utilised face-to-face deliv -
ery ( n = 84), of which approximately half (n  = 43) were 
provided individually [27– 52] while the remainder were 
delivered via groups [43, 53–83]. Twenty-five (22.7%) of 
these face-to-face interventions were supported by additional 
modalities, such as printed or emailed materials [55– 57, 
84–86], telephone [41, 66, 87, 88], videos [89, 90], or a 
combination of these [71, 73, 91].
Sixteen studies utilised a digital health modality (such 
as an online platform, or a mobile application) [82, 92–97]. 
Within this group, wearable devices were also utilised as 
either the primary delivery modality [98] or accompany -
ing another delivery modality [57, 87, 88, 98]. Nine utilised 
telehealth, of which 8 delivered content over phone calls 
and 1 investigated SMS delivery [99], whereby participants 
were sent education material over text messages. Delivery 
modalities less frequently used included DVDs [100] and 
print [98, 101– 103].
Intervention duration
The duration of the interventions ranged from 2 to 104 
weeks (M  = 20, Mdn = 12). 50.9% of the interventions 
were delivered over 12 weeks or less, with the most common 
intervention durations being 12 weeks (31.8%), 26 weeks 
(15.5%), and 52 weeks (17.3%).
Health behaviours targeted
Physical activity Most included interventions addressed 
physical activity (n  = 107, 93.9%). Twenty-two interventions 
targeted aerobic activity (e.g. walking, cycling) [28– 30, 34, 
43, 45, 50, 51, 57, 58, 61, 63, 75, 80, 81, 91, 104, 105]. 
Seven interventions focused on resistance exercises (e.g. lift-
ing weights) [35, 40, 48, 67, 78]. Thirty-four interventions 
promoted a combination  of aerobic and resistance exercises 
[27, 31–33, 36–39, 41, 42, 52, 53, 55, 59, 68, 76, 77, 79, 83, 
85, 89, 90, 93, 101, 103, 106– 108]. Four interventions prac-
ticed yoga [60, 62, 72] and one intervention [70] involved 
a combination of aerobic, resistance, and yoga exercises. 
Twenty-five interventions did not specify a particular exer -
cise, instead focusing on increasing minutes of physical 
activity per week [46 , 47, 54, 71, 74, 82, 86, 87, 94–100, 
Journal of Cancer Survivorship 
102, 109], reducing sedentary time [92], or a combination 
of these [69, 88, 110].
Nutrition Thirty-five (30.7%) of the included interventions 
contained a nutritional component. Of these interventions, 
12 focused on diet restriction through decreasing certain 
food groups consumed [56], or reducing total daily calorie 
intake [50]. Common recommendations for daily calorie 
intake in the included interventions were between 1200 and 
2000 kcal/day [38, 58, 83] or reducing the participants cur -
rent calorie intake by 600 kcal [ 85]. Comparatively, six inter -
ventions focused on dietary change  and promoted increasing certain food groups [65, 84, 97], such as 5 servings of veg-
etables and 2 servings of fruit per day, and increasing intake 
of nuts, grains, and fish. Thirteen interventions utilised a 
combination of dietary restriction and dietary change strate-
gies [34, 55, 59, 69, 79, 87, 105– 108]. Two inventions cited 
a particular diet plan, such as an anti-inflammatory diet [73] 
or the Mediterranean diet [56]. Six interventions included 
non-specified dietary guidance or counselling [70, 74, 77, 
95, 99, 111]. Three interventions included recommendations 
to decrease alcohol consumption [ 55, 85, 108].Fig. 1  PRISMA flow diagram of included studies
 Journal of Cancer Survivorship
Mental health Overall, 19 of the 110 (17.3%) interventions 
featured a mental health component in their protocol. Six 
provided mental health treatment based on evidence based 
psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural 
therapy [45, 66, 95, 97, 105] or Mindfulness-Based Stress 
Reduction [79]. Seven interventions included psycho-edu-
cational material on social and emotional well-being [99], 
stress management [46, 56, 112], mindfulness [77], or psy -
chological adjustment following a cancer diagnosis [111]. 
One intervention utilised meditation following a yoga ses-
sion [60]. Three interventions described the use of ‘psycho-
logical support’ or counselling but did not provide further 
details [38, 42, 76].
Meta‑analysis of overall intervention effects
Post-treatment data was available for meta-analysis from 48 
articles for total QoL (Fig.  2), 50 for physical well-being 
(Fig.  3), 50 for emotional well-being (Fig.  4), and 48 for 
social well-being (Fig.  5).
The overall pooled effect size of the interventions demon-
strated a small significant, positive effect of healthy lifestyle 
interventions on cancer survivors’ total QoL (g  = 0.32, 95% 
CI [0.17, 0.48], p >.001), physical well-being (g  = 0.19, 95% CI [0.01, 0.36], p  = 0.05), emotional well-being (g  = 
0.20, 95% CI [0.10, 0.31], p  >.001), and social well-being 
(g = 0.18, 95% CI [0.05, 0.31], p  = 0.01) in comparison to 
waitlist or usual care controls. For total QoL, 1 interven-
tion demonstrated a negative effect, and favoured the con-
trol group over the intervention group [113]. Similar results 
were found for each of the subscale outcomes, whereby 3 
interventions demonstrated negative effects (favouring the 
control condition) for physical well-being [73, 78, 113], 3 
for emotional well-being [67, 95, 113, 114], and 2 for social 
well-being [103]. Consequently, these results should be 
interpreted with caution. According to Cohen’s criteria, sub-
stantial heterogeneity was observed for emotional well-being 
(Q = 142.99, p  <.001; I2 = 65.73) and considerable hetero-
geneity was observed for total QoL (Q  = 236.19, p  <.001; 
I2 = 80.10), physical well-being (Q  = 384.89, p  <.001; I2 
= 87.27), and social well-being (Q  = 248.98, p  <.001; I2 = 
81.12); visual inspection of each forest plot demonstrates 
dispersion across 0.

inclusion of a mental health component, mode of delivery, 
and the duration of the intervention on each of the QoL 
outcomes.
Mental health component There were no significant dif-
ferences in effect between interventions with or without a 
mental health component. Heterogeneity varied across these 
analyses: Heterogeneity was considerable on total QoL and 
emotional well-being subscales, whereas physical well-being 
and social well-being had no significant heterogeneity.
Modality The mode of delivery subgroup analyses demon-
strated a significant subgroup effect on total QoL and physi-
cal well-being. For total QoL, the individual ( g = 0.65, 95% 
CI [0.27, 1.03]) and group modalities (g  = 0.35, 95% CI 
[0.14, 0.57]) were associated with significant positive effects 
(favouring the intervention group). No other delivery modal-
ity was significant. Conversely, on the physical well-being 
outcome, only the individual modality ( g = 0.36, 95% CI 
[0.03, 0.68]) was associated with a significant positive effect 
(favouring the intervention). However, these results should 
be interpreted with caution due to covariation distribution. 
Only two or three trials were included in the analysis for 
the print, telehealth, and multiple subgroups. Therefore, we cannot confidentially conclude that this is a true subgroup 
effect. Heterogeneity notably reduced in the group modality 
subgroup with the social well-being outcome and reduced 
in the smaller groups across the analyses, specifically the 
telephone and print subgroups.
Duration There was a significant subgroup effect of duration 
on the physical well-being outcome. Shorter interventions 
(g = 0.33, 95% CI [0.18, 0.49]) were associated with a small 
positive effect and favoured the intervention group, whereas 
longer interventions (g  = −0.04, 95% CI [−0.35, 0.26]) did 
not demonstrate a significant effect. However, substantial 
unexplained heterogeneity remained within each of the 
subgroups.
Sources of heterogeneity The post hoc subgroup analyses 
exploring additional sources of heterogeneity are also pre-
sented in Table  1. None of the post hoc subgroup analy -
ses identified significant associations across all outcomes. 
Heterogeneity remained considerable across these subgroup 
analyses, with the exception of studies which measured QoL 
as their primary outcome on the social well-being subscale 
(I2 = 15.20), and studies which used the SF to measure Study name Intervention

physical well-being (I2 = 32.64) and social well-being sub-
scales (I2 = 22.69). 
Narrative synthesis of interventions on QoL
Twenty-two studies investigating 31 interventions were 
excluded from the meta-analysis as they did not provide 
post-treatment means and standard deviations [36, 38, 43, 
48, 51, 53, 59, 74, 76, 80, 86, 89–91, 98, 107– 109, 111, 
115, 116]. Total QoL was reported in 14 studies evaluating 
19 interventions. Of these, 5 (26.3%) interventions demon-
strated significant improvements compared to control [36, 
38, 51, 76, 91]. For physical well-being, 10 of the 25 inter -
ventions (40%) reporting this outcome showed significant 
improvements compared to control [ 36, 51, 74, 91, 111, 
115]. In terms of emotional well-being, 6 of the 24 inter -
ventions (25%) reported greater improvements in the inter -
vention group [51, 76, 91, 115], though in one study [43] 
this benefit was only found in a subgroup of participants 
(those not currently taking endocrine therapy). Lastly, for 
social well-being, only 1 out of 25 interventions reported 
significant improvements compared to a waitlist interven-
tion [ 111]. Moreover, Saarto and colleagues [ 80] found that 
an aerobic exercise intervention demonstrated significantly less change over time in social well-being compared to the 
usual care control group.
Three studies investigated 5 interventions with a mental 
health component, all of which showed significant improve-
ments in at least one area of QoL. Three of the interventions 
utilised individual counselling and demonstrated significant 
improvements in total QoL [38, 76], physical well-being [42, 
76], and emotional well-being [76] compared to the con-
trol groups. Naumann and colleagues [76] also investigated 
group counselling, which demonstrated significant improve-
ments in physical well-being compared to the control group. 
Lastly, one intervention investigated by Chang and col-
leagues [111] involved an e-health booklet on psychological 
adjustment after cancer and this intervention demonstrated 
significant improvements in physical well-being and social 
well-being compared to the control group.
In terms of mode of delivery, all interventions that dem-
onstrated significant improvements in all QoL measures uti-
lised face-to-face delivery [individual n  = 6, group n = 3; 
36, 38, 51, 76, 91, 111], with the exception of one telehealth 
intervention implemented by Baruth and colleagues [115], 
which demonstrated significant improvements in physical 
well-being and emotional well-being in comparison to the 
control group.Study name Intervention

Finally, with regard to duration, 17 interventions were 
offered over 12 weeks or less. Of these interventions, 4 
(23.5%) demonstrated improvements in total Qol [36, 38, 
51, 76], 7 (41.2%) demonstrated significant improvements 
in physical well-being [36, 42, 51, 76, 111, 115], 4 (23.5%) 
demonstrated significant improvements in emotional well-
being [51, 76, 115], and 1 (5.8%) demonstrated significant 
improvements in social well-being [111] compared to the 
control group. Fourteen interventions were delivered over 
13 weeks or more. Only 1 (7.1%) intervention demonstrated 
improvements in total QoL [91], 3 (21.4%) demonstrated 
improvements in physical well-being [59, 74, 91], and 1 
(7.1%) demonstrated improvements in emotional well-being 
in comparison to the control group [91].
Risk of bias
The results from the risk of bias assessment are presented in 
Table 3 (Multimedia C) and a visual representation is pro-
vided in Fig.  6. Overall, the risk of bias was high for 55.9% 
of articles included in the meta-analysis. Domain 5, selec-
tion of the reported result, was the biggest contributor for 
risk of bias concerns, as most of the studies did not publish 
prespecified measurements or a data analysis plan. Conse-
quently, only 5 studies were rated as having low risk of bias.Publication bias
Publication bias was indicated by the Egger’s regression 
intercept for the Total QoL outcome, 1.90, 95% CI [0.40, 
3.40], p = .01, and the emotional well-being subscale, 1.92, 
95% CI [0.09, 3.75], p = .04.
Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis updates and 
extends the current evidence for the use of healthy lifestyle 
interventions to improve the QoL in post-treatment cancer 
survivors. Overall, results from the meta-analysis indicate 
a small but significant effect in favour of healthy lifestyle 
interventions’ positive impact on total QoL and on the 
dimensions of physical well-being, emotional well-being, 
and social well-being compared to a usual care or waitlist 
control. However, there was notable heterogeneity among 
the included studies and the majority did not find a signifi-
cant effect of the intervention on all QoL outcomes. This 
finding was corroborated by studies included in the narra-
tive synthesis, where out of 22 healthy lifestyle interventions 
examined, 17 did not differ from the usual care or waitlist 
control groups in each of the QoL domains. The observed Study name Intervention

heterogeneity in the results aligns with the inconsistencies 
found in previous research on this topic.
A unique contribution of this paper was to investigate 
whether the association between the intervention and QoL 
is moderated by key intervention characteristics, primarily 
the inclusion of a mental health component. There was no 
evidence that the inclusion of a mental health component impacted the association between participation in a healthy 
lifestyle intervention and QoL. Consequently, there is a 
discrepancy between what cancer survivors request to be 
part of a healthy lifestyle program and support from cur -
rent research on these interventions impact on QoL. A 
potential explanation is that improving physical well-being 
through physical activity and diet also addresses emotional *The difference between groups is p <0.05

well-being and overall QoL [117]. However, it is premature 
to discount the usefulness of including a mental health com-
ponent, given the small number of studies which continued 
to display high levels of heterogeneity. Consequently, more 
evidence is required to appropriately answer this question. 
Alternatively, including a mental health component may 
have benefits in other areas, such as addressing barriers 
experienced by cancer survivors in participating in physical 
activity and a nutritious diet [18, 19]. Furthermore, psycho-
social issues are one of the most prominent unmet needs 
described by cancer survivors [118] and including a com-
ponent addressing these has the potential to make cancer 
survivors feel more supported following treatment. There-
fore, future reviews might consider investigating whether 
including a mental health component in a healthy lifestyle 
intervention is associated with increased physical activity 
and diet outcomes or promotes more positive qualitative 
feedback compared to interventions which do not.
In contrast, mode of delivery and intervention duration 
emerged as predictors of intervention efficacy: Face-to-face 
delivery, either individually or in a group format, was associ-
ated with significantly higher total QoL. Individual face-to-
face delivery was also associated with significantly higher 
physical well-being. Similarly, shorter interventions were 
associated with greater improvements in physical well-being. 
This finding aligns to some extent with the findings from a 
meta-analysis completed by Ferrer and colleagues [7 ], which 
investigated exercise interventions for cancer survivors and 
also found that intervention duration was inversely associ-
ated with QoL outcomes. However, Ferrer and colleagues 
found one exception to this relationship where the intensity  
of the intervention moderated outcomes, such that longer 
interventions (i.e. 26 weeks) with higher intensity exercise 
were associated with greater changes in QoL than shorter 
interventions (i.e. 8 weeks) and/or interventions with lower 
intensity exercise. Thus, while select longer interventions 
may be beneficial, collectively the weight of evidence from 
both prior and current meta-analyses support the implemen-
tation of short-term and face-to-face delivered healthy life-
style interventions at the completion of cancer treatment, 
particularly for those looking to improve their physical 
well-being.
Nagpal and colleagues [ 119] have previously recom -
mended that adherence is an important consideration when 
evaluating the efficacy of exercise interventions, due to the 
implications on whether participants receive the recom-
mended ‘dose.’ Shorter durations and face-to-face modali-
ties may promote greater engagement and adherence by 
minimising time commitments and enhancing accountabil-
ity [120]. Further, interventions involving intense exercise 
may necessitate supervision to ensure participant safety and 
offer the advantage of increased accountability and tailor -
ing. However, adherence data was not extracted in either the current study, nor the meta-analysis conducted by Ferrer and 
colleagues. To date, no research has directly compared the 
degree of adherence to shorter verses longer healthy life-
style interventions in the cancer survivor or other relevant 
populations, such as older individuals or individuals with 
other chronic health conditions. Consequently, future pri-
mary research should consider comparing the same healthy 
lifestyle interventions with differing durations or delivery 
modalities to investigate adherence and its relationship to 
QoL outcomes. Future reviews should consider extracting 
adherence data to investigate its relationship with other inter -
vention characteristics and outcomes. This meta-analysis 
provides preliminary evidence to suggest that interventions 
delivered via telephone or online can lead to comparable 
outcomes to face-to-face interventions; however, more stud-
ies are required to compare the different delivery modalities 
on QoL in cancer survivors.
Limitations
Although the overall meta-analysis and subgroup analyses 
yielded significant findings, these results should be inter -
preted with caution due to high levels of heterogeneity, lim-
ited power, high risk of bias, and lack of follow-up data. 
High levels of heterogeneity are commonly reported in 
meta-analyses on this topic. Notable heterogeneity continued 
across the pre-defined subgroup analyses, with only a reduc-
tion observed in individual subgroups, typically character -
ised by a low number of included studies (i.e. fewer than 10 
studies). Additionally, the current meta-analysis may have 
limited power to detect an effect of the healthy lifestyle inter -
ventions on QoL, as less than one third of the included stud-
ies were designed to measure QoL. Consequently, the major -
ity of the included studies may not be adequately powered 
to detect an effect on QoL. We attempted to address these 
limitations through post hoc subgroup analyses investigating 
multi-verse single-component interventions, whether QoL 
was measured as a primary or secondary outcome, and the 
type of outcome used, however, nil differences or reductions 
in heterogeneity were observed. Additionally, the validity 
of the results may be impacted by the quality of the studies, 
as the majority of them presented with a high risk of bias. 
Finally, as this current meta-analysis did not extract follow-
up data, we are unable to evaluate whether the effects on 
QoL are maintained after the intervention period.
Additionally, there may be clinical factors that may mod-
erate the efficacy of healthy lifestyle interventions on QoL 
in cancer survivors that were not explored in this study. A 
recent follow-up analysis conducted by Schleicher and col-
leagues [121] identified that breast cancer survivors par -
ticipating the BEAT intervention who had a longer time 
since diagnosis (<24 months) and those who did not have a 
history of chemotherapy demonstrated greater increases in 
Journal of Cancer Survivorship 
QoL. Schleicher and colleagues suggested that this may be 
due to perceived physical functioning, as cancer survivors 
with a more recent diagnosis may be experiencing acute side 
effects from treatment, such as fatigue and nausea. This find -
ing was particularly relevant for time since diagnosis, as 
those who were more than 24 months post treatment were 
also more likely to engage in more moderate and vigorous 
physical activity post treatment. Future systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses should consider extracting data on time 
since diagnosis and treatment type to explore these as poten-
tial moderating factors.
Conclusion
Overall, the current meta-analysis suggests that participat-
ing in any healthy lifestyle intervention following cancer 
treatment is likely to have positive benefits on QoL. Inter -
ventions which are delivered face-to-face or over a shorter 
duration may have a greater impact on the efficacy of such 
interventions; however, only a few randomised control tri -
als have investigated alternative delivery modalities, such 
as digital or telehealth. Furthermore, few randomised con-
trol trials have specifically investigated the inclusion of a 
mental health component to healthy lifestyle interventions. 
Consequently, there is a need for future research to develop 
and rigorously evaluate healthy lifestyle interventions which 
also address mental health and utilise alternative delivery 
modalities.

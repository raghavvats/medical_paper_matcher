THE NUMBER OF OLDER PEOPLE IS
growing rapidly worldwide.
More than 580 million peopleare older than 60 years, and the
number is projected to rise to 1000 mil-lion by 2020.
1With the increase in life
expectancy, the leading causes of deathhave shifted dramatically from infec-tious diseases to noncommunicable dis-eases and from younger to older indi-viduals. In industrialized countries,about 75% of deaths in persons olderthan the age of 65 are now from car-diovascular diseases and cancer.
2
Regardless of predisposing factors,
diet and lifestyle influence morbidityand mortality during the course of life.
2
Because of the cumulative effect of ad-verse factors throughout life, it is par-ticularly important for older persons toadopt diet and lifestyle practices thatminimize their risk of death from mor-bidity and maximize their prospects forhealthful aging.

Dietary patterns and other modifi-
able lifestyle factors are associated withmortality from all causes, coronaryheart disease (CHD), cardiovascular
diseases (CVD), and cancer.

few studies have investigated the com-bined effect of diet and other lifestylefactors.

causes, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, but few studieshave investigated these factors in combination.
Objective To investigate the single and combined effect of Mediterranean diet, being
physically active, moderate alcohol use, and nonsmoking on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in European elderly individuals.
Design, Setting, and Participants The Healthy Ageing: a Longitudinal study in
Europe (HALE) population, comprising individuals enrolled in the Survey in Europe onNutrition and the Elderly: a Concerned Action (SENECA) and the Finland, Italy, theNetherlands, Elderly (FINE) studies, includes 1507 apparently healthy men and 832women, aged 70 to 90 years in 11 European countries. This cohort study was con-ducted between 1988 and 2000.
Main Outcome Measures Ten-year mortality from all causes, coronary heart dis-
ease, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.
Results During follow-up, 935 participants died: 371 from cardiovascular diseases,
233 from cancer, and 145 from other causes; for 186, the cause of death was un-known. Adhering to a Mediterranean diet (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% confidenceinterval [CI], 0.68-0.88), moderate alcohol use (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.91), physi-cal activity (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55-0.72), and nonsmoking (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57-0.75) were associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HRs controlled for age,sex, years of education, body mass index, study, and other factors). Similar results wereobserved for mortality from coronary heart disease, cardiovascular diseases, and can-cer. The combination of 4 low risk factors lowered the all-cause mortality rate to 0.35(95% CI, 0.28-0.44). In total, lack of adherence to this low-risk pattern was associ-ated with a population attributable risk of 60% of all deaths, 64% of deaths from coro-nary heart disease, 61% from cardiovascular diseases, and 60% from cancer.
Conclusion Among individuals aged 70 to 90 years, adherence to a Mediterranean
diet and healthful lifestyle is associated with a more than 50% lower rate of all-causesand cause-specific mortality.

METHODS
Study Population
The HALE project included partici-pants of the Survey in Europe on Nu-trition and the Elderly: a Concerned Ac-tion (SENECA) and Finland, Italy, theNetherlands, Elderly (FINE) studieswho were examined in 1988-1991 andwere followed up for 10 years. Detailsabout the SENECA and FINE studieshave been described elsewhere
10,11and
are briefly summarized herein.
The SENECA study started in 1988
and consisted of a random age- and sex-stratified sample of inhabitants, born be-tween 1913 and 1918, of 19 Europeantowns. In the HALE project, 13 centersthat carried out mortality follow-up wereincluded. The original participation ratein the centers varied from 37% to 81%.
12
Surveys were repeated in 1993 and 1999.The response rates for SENECA were68% in 1993 and 55% in 1999, and forFINE they were 86% in 1993 and 85%in 1993. All men and women of the fol-lowing towns were included: Hamme,Belgium; Roskilde, Denmark;Strasbourg, France; Valence, France;Iraklion, Greece; Monor, Hungary;Padua, Italy; Culemborg, the Nether-lands; Vila Franca de Xira, Portugal;Betanzos, Spain; and Yverdon, Burg-dorf, and Bellinzona, Switzerland.
10
The FINE study consists of the sur-
vivors of 5 cohorts of the Seven Coun-tries Study: Ilomantsi, East Finland;Po¨ytya¨, and Mellila ¨, West Finland; Cre-
valcore and Montegiorgio, Italy; andZutphen, the Netherlands. The FINEstudy, which started in 1984 and con-tinued to 2000, recruited men who wereborn between 1900 and 1920. For ourstudy, we used the 1989-1991 base-line measurements of men aged 70 to90 years.
11Surveys were repeated in the
years 1994-1995 and 1999-2000. Theresponse rates in 1989-1991 were 92%for the Finnish cohorts, 74% for theDutch cohort, and 76% for the Italian
cohorts.
13
Because CHD, CVD, cancer, and dia-
betes increase the risk of mortality andcan induce changes in diet and life-style, participants who had these dis-eases were excluded at baseline. The av-erage follow-up time was 10 years inboth SENECA and FINE.
In both studies, food consumption
data were collected by trained dieti-tians using a dietary history method.
10,11
This method provides informationabout the usual food consumption ofthe participants from the month be-fore the interview in SENECA and from2 to 4 weeks before the interview inFINE. The central part of the dietaryhistory was the same for both studies.The coding was based on frequencytables, which were the same in bothstudies, but the start of the dietary in-terview about usual food consump-tion patterns was based on a foodrecord and by an oral interview inFINE. Both dietary histories were vali-dated.
10, 13
Information on smoking status;
physical activity level; educationalachievement (number of years); theprevalence of CHD, stroke, diabetes,and cancer; the use of antihyperten-sive medication (only in FINE); and oc-cupation (only in FINE) was collectedusing questionnaires. The prevalence ofchronic diseases was confirmed by gen-eral practitioners, hospital registrants,or both in the FINE study only.
Information on physical habitual ac-
tivity was obtained using the Voorripsquestionnaire in SENECA and the Mor-ris questionnaire in FINE.
14,15Both
questionnaires were developed for re-tired elderly individuals and focus onleisure-time activities, such as walk-ing, cycling, and gardening. SENECAalso included household activities.
14,15
Weight, height, and waist circum-
ference (SENECA only) measure-ments have been described in detailelsewhere.
10,11Body mass index (BMI)
was calculated as weight in kilogramsdivided by height in meters squared. Inthe analyses, BMI was dichotomized as25 or less vs greater than 25. The HALEstudy comprised 98.6% of individuals
who lived independently.
Definition of Low-Risk Groups
To assess the association of diet and thelifestyle factors with mortality, a low-risk group was defined for diet and life-style factors. For dietary intake, the low-risk group was defined as those whohad a score of at least 4 on a modifiedversion of the Mediterranean diet scoreproposed by Trichopoulou et al.
4
The modified Mediterranean diet score
comprised 8 components: ratio of mono-unsaturated to saturated fat; legumes,nuts, and seeds; grains; fruit; vegetablesand potatoes; meat and meat products;dairy products; and fish. Intake of eachcomponent was adjusted to daily in-takes of 2500 kcal (10.5 MJ) for men and2000 kcal (8.5 MJ) for women. The sex-specific median intake values were takenas cutoff points. The diet score variedfrom 0 (low-quality diet) to 8 (high-quality diet). For the components mono-unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fattyacids (MUFA to SAFA) ratio; fruits andfruit products; vegetables and potatoes;legumes, nuts, and seeds; fish; and grains,a value of 1 was assigned to personswhose consumption was at least as highas the sex-specific median value, and 0to the others. The vegetables group of theoriginal Mediterranean diet score was re-placed by the vegetables and potatoesgroup because the European classifica-tion system (EUROCODE) was usedwhen the 2 food groups were assessedtogether.
16For meat and meat products
and dairy products, a value of 1 was as-signed to persons whose consumptionwas less than the sex-specific median and0 to the others .
The low-risk group for alcohol was
defined as those who consumed moret h a n0go f alcohol per day. Alcohol
consumption was initially divided into3 groups: 0 g, 1 to 29 g, and 30 g ormore of alcohol per day. However, theKaplan-Meier survival curves of the 3alcohol groups showed no difference insurvival between participants who con-sumed betwee n1gt o2 9go f alcohol
per day and those who consumed 30 gor more alcohol per day.DIET, LIFESTYLE, AND 10-YEAR MORTALITY IN THE ELDERLY

For smoking, individuals were con-
sidered to be at low risk if they hadnever smoked or had stopped smok-ing more than 15 years ago.
17-19
Individuals with a score in the inter-
mediate and the highest tertile on theVoorrips or Morris questionnaire wereconsidered the low-risk group for physi-cal activity.
14,15
A lifestyle score was calculated by
adding the individual scores for diet,physical activity level, smoking sta-tus, and alcohol intake. Individualsscored 1 point if they belonged to thelow-risk group for diet or a particularlifestyle factor and 0 if they belongedto the high-risk group. In total, an in-dividual could obtain 4 points: 1 pointfor a Mediterranean diet and 3 pointsfor the healthful lifestyle factors.
Health Status
Information on vital status and causesof death was collected every 5 years inFINE and in 1999-2000 for SENECAand was available for 99.7% of partici-pants. Causes of death were coded byan experienced physician and classi-fied according to the International Clas-
sification of Diseases, Ninth Revision(ICD-9 ) coding system.
20Codes 410-
414 were used for defining CHD, codes390-459 for CVD, and codes 140-240for cancer. Causes of death were avail-able for 92% of the participants in FINEand 72% of the participants in SENECA.Mortality from other causes was de-fined as total mortality minus the deathsfrom unknown causes, CHD, CVD,and cancer.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out us-ing the SAS statistical software ver-sion 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Be-fore pooling the data for SENECA andFINE, a test for heterogeneity was per-formed, which was not significant(P=.93); no significant interactions be-
tween diet, lifestyle factors, and studywere found. Cox proportional haz-ards models were used to estimate thesingle and the combined effect of diet,smoking status, alcohol consumption,and physical activity level on mortal-ity.
21In the analyses for cause-specific
mortality and mortality from othercauses, individuals with a missing causeof death were excluded. For all mod-els, the Cox proportional hazards as-sumption was tested and met. Dummyvariables were created for the numberof healthful dietary and lifestyle fac-tors; a score of 0 or 1 for the healthfuldietary and lifestyle factor was used asreference category.
All models were adjusted for the
other diet and lifestyle factors, sex, ageat baseline, BMI, and study popula-tion (SENECA vs FINE). To correct theestimates for socioeconomic status, themodels were adjusted for the numberof years of education.
Region (northern or southern
Europe), center, occupation, waist cir-cumference (continuous), maritalstatus, and use of antihypertensive medi-cation were tested as potential confound-ers but did not affect our estimates. Be-cause several studies indicate thatexposure to pesticides and industrial-ized environment increases the risk ofmortality,
22we classified participants’ oc-
cupation as farmers (an indicator of pes-ticide exposure) vs nonfarmers andwhether individuals were exposed or notexposed to an industrialized environ-ment. Occupation as farmer and expo-sure to an industrialized environmentalso did not affect our results.
To minimize the possibility that diet
or lifestyle factors had changed in re-sponse to subclinical disease, the analy-ses were repeated after excluding thefirst 2 years of mortality follow-up.
9In-
teractions between all dietary and life-style factors and confounders weretested, but none of them was statisti-cally significant at /H9251=.1. To ensure that
the estimates were not biased by mul-ticollinearity, the crude hazard ratios(HRs) for the dietary and lifestyle fac-tors were also calculated and com-pared with the adjusted HRs. The crudeHRs and the adjusted HRs were simi-lar, indicating that the estimates werenot biased by multicollinearity.
Population attributable risk, an esti-
mate of the percentage of mortality inthis population that would not have oc-curred if all participants were in the
low-risk group, was calculated.
9,23
The unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curves
for the number of protective factors inrelation to all-cause mortality were fit-ted and the log-rank test was calcu-lated. P/H11021.05 was considered to be sta-
tistically significant for all possiblepredictors in the model, but to inves-tigate interaction between all predic-tors, we considered P/H11021.01 to be statis-
tically significant.
RESULTS
Information about diet, lifestyle fac-
tors, and vital status was available for1507 men (781 from the SENECAstudy, 726 from the FINE study) and832 women without CHD, CVD, dia-betes, and cancer at baseline ( T
ABLE 1).
Men in the SENECA study were 7 yearsyounger on average than men in theFINE study. The median of the dietscore in the total population was 4;3 in northern Europe vs 5 in southernEurope. The mean alcohol intake was21 g/d for men and 6 g/d for women.In northern Europe, the mean alcoholconsumption was 17.5 g/d for men and5.5 g/d for women compared with 31g/d for men and 6 g/d for women insouthern Europe. The cutoff point forthe lowest percentile for activity in theFINE study was 200 min/wk, whichmeans approximately 30 minutes of ac-tivity per day, with an intensity higherthan 2.0 kcal/kg per hour each day. Inthe SENECA study, there were almost5 times as many male smokers as therewere female smokers. The mean fol-low-up time was 10 years, with a rangeof 8.9 to 10.5 years. Twice as many mendied during the 10-year follow-up as didwomen.

nean diet, moderate alcohol consump-tion, moderate to high physical activ-ity levels, and nonsmoking wereassociated with lower mortality ratesfrom all causes, CHD, CVD, cancer, andother causes during the 10-year follow-up.

all-cause and cause-specific mortality
compared with individuals with 0 or 1low-risk factor during 10 years of fol-low-up ( T
ABLE 3). Sixty percent of all
deaths were associated with not adher-ing to this low-risk pattern. For cause-specific mortality, 64% of deaths dueto CHD; 61% due to CVD; 60% due tocancer, and 61% due to other causesduring the 10-year follow-up periodwere associated with not adhering tothis low-risk pattern. Including indi-viduals with CHD, CVD, cancer, or dia-betes at baseline in the analysis andadjusting for prevalence of these long-term diseases at baseline did not changeour estimates.
Similar results were found after ex-
cluding from the analysis the 140 per-sons who died during the first 2 years offollow-up: adhering to a Mediterraneandiet (HR, 0.77; 95% confidence interval[CI], 0.67-0.89), moderate alcohol con-sumption (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.91),engaging in physical activity (HR, 0.65;95% CI, 0.56-0.76), and nonsmoking(HR, 0.67, 95% CI, 0.57-0.78) were as-sociated with a significantly lower riskof all-cause mortality. The combinationof 4 low-risk factors lowered the all-cause mortality rate to 0.37 (95% CI,0.29-0.47). For cause-specific mortal-ity, the HRs for the single and the com-bined effects from dietary and lifestylefactors were also similar after excludingthe first 2 years of follow-up.

COMMENT
During the 10-year follow-up, men and
women between the ages of 70 and 90years who had adhered to a Mediter-ranean diet, were nonsmokers or hadstopped smoking more than 15 yearsago, were physically active, and used al-cohol moderately had less than half themortality rate from all causes, CHD,CVD, and cancer, and mortality fromother causes than those who did not.
Advantages of this Europe-wide
study were its great diversity in di-etary patterns and lifestyle factors, itsprospective nature, its large sample size,and its measurements of many poten-tial confounders. SENECA and FINEcould be pooled because the estimatesof the separate models were similar andthere were no important differences instudy population and measurement ofrisk factors. To ensure that the rela-tionships between diet, lifestyle fac-tors, and mortality could not be ex-plained by a study effect, this variablewas included as a potential con-founder in all pooled analyses.
This study also had several limita-
tions. Despite the large number of par-ticipants and long follow-up, few caseshad no healthful diet or lifestyle fac-tors. Therefore, we had to combinethose who had scores of 0 or 1 in thehealthful diet and lifestyle factor rank-ing to have a stable reference cat-egory. The initial response rate in theSENECA centers was lower (37%-81%) than in the FINE centers (74%-92%).
12,13In prospective cohort stud-
ies, distributions of dietary and lifestylefactors in the study population mayhave been affected by selective partici-pation in the different cohorts. How-ever, we had almost 100% mortality fol-low-up, so the relationships betweendietary factors and mortality should notbe distorted.
24Another limitation is the
low number of deaths due to cause-specific mortality; for example, only 122deaths were from CHD. Due to theselow numbers, it is possible that thepower was too low to find a signifi-cant effect of all dietary and lifestyle fac-
tors in the cause-specific analysis.
A Mediterranean diet score of 4 or
more points was associated with a lowerrisk of all-cause and cause-specific mor-tality; the strongest association was ob-served for CHD. The Mediterranean diet
scale relies on generally strong epide-miological evidence concerning the in-dividual dietary components.
4,6The
components of the diet score have beenvalidated.

The lifestyle score was calculated by adding the individual scores for diet, physical activity level, smoking sta-
tus, and alcohol intake. Individuals scored 1 point if they belonged to the low-risk group for diet or a particularlifestyle factor and 0 if they belonged to the high-risk group. In total, an individual could obtain 4 points: 1point for a Mediterranean diet and 3 points for the healthful lifestyle factors.Table 3.

volving elderly persons in which a
Mediterranean diet score similar to ourswas used, the reduction in overall mor-tality associated with increased adher-ence to the Mediterranean diet was alsosimilar to that found in our study. Simi-lar results were also noted for mortal-ity from CHD and cancer.
4Our results
are also compatible with those of 2 ran-domized trials of secondary preven-tion of CHD through the use of vari-ants of the Mediterranean diet.
26,27
In the Mediterranean diet score pro-
posed by Trichopoulou et al,4alcohol was
also included. In our study, alcohol wasconsidered as a separate lifestyle factorbecause many studies observed an inde-pendent effect of alcohol on sur-vival.
28-30When we included alcohol in
our diet score, we found that individu-als scoring 4 or more points on the origi-nal Mediterranean diet score have a 14%lower risk of mortality compared with23% in the present study. Participantswho were physically active had a lowerrisk of all-cause and cause-specific mor-tality. Other studies found also that a sed-entary lifestyle was associated with a sig-nificantly higher risk of all-cause andcause-specific mortality compared withbeing moderately active.
17,31Davis et al17
reported that nonrecreational physicalactivity was an even better predictor ofsurvival time in older persons (aged65-74 years) than in middle-aged per-sons (aged 45-54 years).
17
Nonsmoking was associated with
lower risk from all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Other studies alsofound that smokers had a higher mor-tality risk although the relative risk waslower in older persons than in middle-aged individuals.
17,18
Although diet and lifestyle habits can
change over time, generally they arecharacteristic of a person’s way of liv-ing and reflect lifelong health hab-its.
32,33For smoking, we contrasted per-
sons who never smoked or stoppedsmoking more than 15 years ago withthose who still smoked or stopped lessthan 15 years ago. This definition of thesmoking variable takes a long expo-sure period into account. In SENECA,dietary and lifestyle factors were mea-sured 5 years apart. The Spearman cor-
relation coefficient for alcohol con-sumption, diet score, and physicalactivity between 1988-1989 and 1993was highly significant ( P/H11021.01), sug-
gesting that diet and lifestyle factorswere stable in older individuals. Sev-eral other studies also found that smok-ing habits and activity patterns inmiddle-aged and many elderly menwere stable over the years.
32,33
A multiplicative model was used to
assess the combined effect of diet andlifestyle factors on all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The more healthfuldietary and lifestyle factors a partici-pant had, the lower the risk for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mor-tality. In the current study, 60% to 64%of mortality was associated with lack ofadherence to this low-risk pattern. Thissupports the hypothesis that partici-pants who follow a Mediterranean typeof diet and maintain a healthful life-style are less likely to die from all-cause and cause-specific mortality evenat ages 70 to 90 years. Establishing acausal relationship would require an in-tervention study, and the number ofyears an individual needs to maintainsuch a lifestyle to realize a benefit is un-known. However, a Mediterranean diet,rich in plant foods in combination withnonsmoking, moderate alcohol con-sumption, and at least 30 minutes ofphysical activity per day is associatedwith a significantly lower mortality rate,even in old age.

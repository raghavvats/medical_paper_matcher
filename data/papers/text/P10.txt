In HER2-positive breast cancer, clini cal outcome and sensitivity to HER2-
targeted therapies are in ﬂuenced by both tumor and microenvironment fea-
tures. However, we are currently unable to depict the molecular heterogeneity
of this disease with suf ﬁcient granularity. Here, by performing gene expression
proﬁling in HER2-positive breast cancers from patients receiving adjuvant
trastuzumab in the ALTTO clinical tr ial (NCT00490139), we identify and
characterize ﬁve molecular subtypes associated with the risk of distant
recurrence: immune-enriched, proliferative/metabolic-enriched, mesenchy-mal/stroma-enriched, luminal, and ER BB2-dependent. Addi tionally, we vali-
date the biological pro ﬁles of the subtypes and explore their prognostic/
predictive value in external cohorts, namely the NeoALTTO trial(NCT00553358), SCAN-B (NCT02306096), I-SPY2 (NCT01042379), METABRICand TCGA. Immune-enriched tumors present better survival outcomes, incontrast to mesenchymal/stroma-enriche d and proliferative/ metabolic-enri-
ched tumors, while luminal and ERBB2-d ependent tumors are characterized by
low and high rates of pathological complete response, respectively. Of note,these molecular subtypes provide the rationale for treatment approaches
leveraging the heterogeneous biol ogy of HER2-positive breast cancer.
Since the demonstration of the prognostic and predictive role of HER2
ampli ﬁcation in breast cancer1, the clinical outcome of early-stage
HER2-positive breast cancer has been profoundly reshaped. Indeed,the introduction of the monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumabin the adjuvant setting
2paved the way for a revolution in the treatment
landscape of HER2-positive breast cancer, and was followed by thedevelopment of effective treatment strategies in both the adjuvant
3–8
and neoadjuvant/post-operative setting9–14.Received: 26 March 2024

While the mainstay of HER2-positive breast cancer treatment is
represented by targeting the HER2 t y r o s i n ek i n a s e ,t h ep r e s e n c eo f
higher levels of the HER2 protein alone is not suf ﬁcient to guarantee
durable responses. Several resistance mechanisms may occur, and the
prediction of response and relapse-risk at the patient ’s level remains
challenging15. Indeed, prognosis and treatment response can be
impacted by a complex network of both tumor cells-intrinsic features[e.g., HER2 downstream signaling and ERBB2 gene ampli ﬁcation
16–20,
luminal differentiation and estrogen receptor (ER) levels16,19–21,
proliferation16,19] and microenvironment characteristics [e.g., immune
inﬁltration described by tumor-in ﬁltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and
immune signatures16,19,22–25, stroma activation19,26–28]. Overall, data col-
lected in biomarker studies point towards a substantial biologicalheterogeneity across HER2-positive tumors, with different processesdriving treatment resistance and outcome. Nonetheless, this inter-
tumor heterogeneity is currently not considered when planning
treatment strategies.
The therapeutic algorithm of HER2-positive breast cancer is
mostly modulated by tumor stage and, in patients receiving neoadju-vant therapies, by the assessment of response at surgery
29. Impor-
tantly, not considering the biology of the disease could potentially leadto over- or under-treatment in a large proportion of patients. In thisregard, the HER2DX assay has shown the ability to predict response[three groups based on the likelihood of achieving pathological com-plete response (pCR)] and outcome (two prognostic groups) in HER2-positive breast cancer patients using 4 gene modules describing
immune activation, luminal phenotype, proliferation and the expres-
sion of the HER2 amplicon, as well as clinical features
16. In addition to
these advancements, a re ﬁned de ﬁnition of molecular subgroups of
HER2-positive breast cancer may potentially allow to better tailortreatment strategies.
In this retrospective exploratory analysis of the phase III ALTTO
trial
6, we identify gene expression-based features and ﬁve molecular
subtypes associated with distant recurrence and overall survival in acase-control cohort of patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab. Thesesubtypes, depicting both tumor-intrinsic and microenvironment fea-tures, reveal a substantial heterogeneity associated with outcome in
HER2-positive breast cancer. Moreover, aiming to validate our ﬁnd-
ings, we identify the molecular subtypes in several external datasets,including the phase III neoadjuvant NeoALTTO trial as well as HER2-positive tumors from the METABRIC, TCGA, I-SPY2, and SCAN-B stu-dies. In-depth gene expression pro ﬁling and evaluation of the prog-
nostic/predictive value of the HER2-positive subtypes demonstrate therobustness of our ﬁndings, which provide the rationale for the eva-
luation of tailored treatment approaches modulated by the biology ofthis disease.
Results
Baseline patients ’characteristics of the ALTTO case-
control cohort
A case-control cohort (1:2 ratio) of patients affected by HER2-positive
breast cancer was identi ﬁed in the trastuzumab-only arm of the
ALTTO clinical trial, based on the presence (cases) or absence (con-trols) of a distant recurrence event after median follow-up of 6.9years. A total of 134 cases and 268 controls matched for clin-icopathological characteristics (details in METHODS) were identi ﬁed
(total N= 402), and their characteristics are summarized in Supple-
mentary Data 1. The median age of this cohort was 51 years (inter-quartile range 44-58). The case-control cohort, balanced for theclinicopathological characteristics used in the matching procedure,
included a high-risk population enriched for distant relapse events
(occurring in 1 patient out of 3), with higher proportions of >2 cm,node-positive and G3 tumors compared to the whole ALTTO tras-tuzumab arm (Supplementary Data 2). The median follow-up for thiscohort was 7 years.After quality check (Supplementary Fig. 2, details in METHODS),
RNA sequencing data were analyzed for 386/402 (96%) patients,including 128 cases and 258 controls. The characteristics of this cohortdid not differ compared to the whole case-control population and are
reported in Supplementary Data 1. The CONSORT diagram showing
the selection of the patients is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1. All thesubsequent analyses are referred to the RNA sequencing cohort.
Association of intrinsic subtypes and gene expression sig-
natures with clinical outcome
As intrinsic subtypes showed a predictive and prognostic value in
HER2-positive breast cancers10,19,20,30,w e ﬁrst aimed to explore their
prognostic role in this case-control cohort. Intrinsic subtypes wereidenti ﬁed with the AIMS classi ﬁer
31. Most of the tumors were classi ﬁed
as HER2-enriched (HER2-E; N= 257/386, 66.6%), followed by luminal B
(N= 82/386, 21.2%) (Supplementary Fig. 3). As expected, the majority
of luminal A ( N= 11/12) and B ( N= 80/82) tumors were hormone
receptor-positive, while basal-like tumors ( N= 16/17) were almost all
hormone receptor-negative.
The HER2-E subtype was associated with worse distant relapse-
free interval (DRFI) and overall survival (OS) at univariable and multi-variable analyses (Supplementary Fig. 4), while luminal A/B tumorsshowed improved outcomes compared to the other AIMS subtypes.
We then evaluated the prognostic role of 34 gene expression
signatures spanning tumor- and microenvironment-related biologicalprocesses, as well as ERBB2 andESR1 expression levels (sources and
genes included available in Supplementary Data 3).
At univariable and multivariable analyses (Supplementary Fig. 5),
immune signatures, including B cell-related ones such as the immu-noglobulin G (IgG) signature included in the HER2DX assay
16,32and a
signature derived from spatial transcriptomics data describing tertiarylymphoid structures (TLS)
33, were associated with a lower risk of
metastatic recurrence. Conversely, higher levels of signatures depict-ing activation of HER2 downstream signaling (AKT/mTOR, RAS), aswell as metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway),IGF1 signaling, stroma activation, and hypoxia showed negative prog-nostic value. Similar results were observed for OS, with the addition of
the luminal HER2DX signature
16being associated with better outcomes
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Correlations between signatures (Supple-mentary Fig. 7, Supplementary Data 4) showed that those describing
similar processes (e.g., signatures related to immune response, orstroma activation, or proliferation) were, as expected, highly corre-lated, whereas signatures having a similar impact on the outcome butdescribing different processes could be weakly or non-signi ﬁcantly
correlated (e.g., luminal HER2DX with immune signatures, both asso-ciated to improved OS; HER2 STROMA signature with IGF1 signaling,glycolysis or AKT/mTOR signaling).
Overall, these results con ﬁrmed the positive prognostic effect of
immune activation and luminal differentiation in patients treated with
adjuvant trastuzumab, while several biological pathways includingmetabolic and stroma-related processes, as well as the HER2-E AIMSsubtype, were associated with worse outcome.
Identi ﬁcation of HER2-positive breast cancer molecular sub-
types associated with the risk of distant relapse
Ourﬁndings highlighted the association of heterogeneous biological
processes to the risk of metastatic recurrence. Thus, we reasonedthat adopting a supervised top-down approach could allow theidenti ﬁcation of prognostic subgroups characterized by distinct
molecular pro ﬁles (i.e., starting from the outcome information,
selecting relevant features able to detect distinct subgroups).
As utilizing gene expression signatures can potentially limit theﬁndings to pre-speci ﬁed processes, we decided to identify single
genes associated with DRFI starting from the whole transcriptome(details in METHODS). At a multivariable analysis adjusted forArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54621-3

clinicopathological characteristics and AIMS subtypes, 1245 genes
remained signi ﬁcantly associated with DRFI after controlling for
multiple testing [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05; SupplementaryData 5]. Those genes were then summarized into 4 factors byapplying dimensionality reduction through non-negative matrixfactorization (NMF; Supplementary Fig. 8a). The number of factors
was decided by measuring the mean Kullback-Leibler divergence for1 to 8 factors across different NMF runs, and based on our a prioriknowledge derived from the gene expression signature analyses(details in the METHODS). Although the occurrence of a distant

relapse event in the history of the disease could be explained by two
groups of genes associated with either better or worse prognosis,identifying a higher number of factors through NMF (i.e., more thantwo) could allow the identi ﬁcation of different processes explaining
similar outcomes, as we have shown in the previous section. We nextperformed k-means clustering on the factor scores obtained, toclassify tumors into distinct subgroups enriched for the identi ﬁed
factors (Supplementary Fig. 8b). This analysis led us to the identi ﬁ-
cation 4 prognostic clusters of HER2-positive breast cancer (Sup-
plementary Fig. 9), which were further characterized performingGene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) on the hallmark gene sets andintegrating the AIMS intrinsic subtype information.
GSVA analysis showed that clusters 1, 2, and 3 presented distinct
biology described by immune signaling (cluster 1), proliferation andmetabolism (cluster 2), and stroma-related processes (cluster 3),whereas cluster 4, the largest one ( N= 154), did not show peculiar
features, suggesting a more mixed nature (Supplementary Fig. 10,Supplementary Data 6). We then evaluated whether AIMS intrinsicsubtypes could still provide prognostic information within each clus-
ter. Differences in outcome, particularly for OS, were observed only in
cluster 4, in which non-HER2-E tumors (the majority, N= 54/63, being
luminal A/B) presented better prognosis (Supplementary Fig. 11).Indeed, multivariable analyses showed that, in cluster 4, HER2-Etumors presented worse outcome compared to the rest [for DRFI:hazard ratio (HR) = 2.3; 95% con ﬁdence interval (CI), 1.1 –5;Pvalue =
0.028; for OS: HR = 6.6; CI, 1.9 –23;Pvalue = 0.00059]. Following this
observation and given the prognostic role of luminal signaling/sub-types described in the previous section, we divided cluster 4 into twogroups according to AIMS intrinsic subtypes (HER2-E vs. others),resulting in 5 ﬁnal HER2-positive subtypes.
Based on gene expression pro ﬁling (Fig. 1, Supplementary
Data 7 and 8), we identi ﬁed immune-enriched tumors (IM, N=6 9 ,
from cluster 1, presenting higher levels of immune signatures), pro-liferative/metabolic-enriched tumors (P/Met, N= 87, from cluster 2,
characterized by proliferation signatures as well as glycolysis, oxi-dative phosphorylation, AKT/mTOR, IGF1, MAPK, MYC signaling, andhigh ERBB2 expression), mesenchymal/stroma-enriched tumors
[Mes/S, N= 76, from cluster 3, mainly characterized by stroma-
related signatures, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angio-genesis, TGF-beta/Notch/Hedgehog/WNT and MAPK signaling, aswell as low proliferation]; moreover, from cluster 4 split based onAIMS, we identi ﬁed the subtypes luminal (LUM, N= 63, with high
estrogen/luminal signaling), and ERBB2-dependent (ERBB2-D, N= 91,
characterized by ERBB2 signaling, high ERBB2 levels and intermediate
proliferation).
Of interest, AIMS intrinsic subtypes, particularly HER2-E tumors,
were redistributed across the HER2-positive subtypes (Fig. 1d, Sup-
plementary Data 9). This is expected in consideration of the differentpurposes of the approaches used to id entify the subtypes (focusing on
HER2-positive breast cancer and outcome in our case, depicting gen-eral breast cancer molecular pro ﬁles for intrinsic subtypes
34). None-
theless, this highlights a certain degree of heterogeneity within AIMSintrinsic subtypes (particularly HER2-E) when considering both tumorand microenvironment features in the context of HER2-positive breastcancer. In addition, the majority of the basal-like became part of the P/
Met subtype, while, also by design, most luminal A/B tumors were
included in the LUM subtype. The IM and LUM tumors showed betterDRFI compared to the other subtypes (Fig. 2), presenting 5-year DRFI
of 91% (CI, 85 –98%) and 87% (CI, 79 –96%), respectively, as well as
excellent OS (in IM, 5-year OS of 96%; CI, 91 –100; in LUM, 5-year OS of
98%, CI, 95 –100%). A worse outcome was instead observed in P/Met
and Mes/S tumors.
With regards to clinicopathological characteristics, hormone
receptor status differed signi ﬁcantly across subtypes (Supplementary
Data 9). In particular, almost all (90.5%) LUM tumors were hormonereceptor-positive; however, only a minority of hormone receptor-positive tumors were classi ﬁed as LUM ( N= 57/212, 26.9%).
Overall, these ﬁndings unveil how inter-tumor heterogeneity of
HER2-positive breast cancer, depicted by different transcriptomicproﬁles capturing both tumor-intrinsic and microenvironment fea-
tures, is able to provide prognostic information in patients treatedwith adjuvant trastuzumab.+++ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + ++++++

Development of a gene expression-based classi ﬁer to identify
the HER2-positive breast cancer subtypes in external cohorts
Following the identi ﬁcation of the HER2-positive molecular subtypes
in ALTTO, we aimed to identify them in external early-stage breastcancer cohorts, namely NeoALTTO
19, I-SPY235, METABRIC36,T C G A34,
and SCAN-B37, while maintaining their most relevant features.
To address this objective, we developed a gene expression-based
classi ﬁer in ALTTO (details regarding the development and application
of the classi ﬁer reported in the METHODS section). First, we per-
formed differential expression analysis comparing each subtype withthe rest. A total of 365 differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.01, |log
2(fold change)| >1.5; Supplementary Data 10) were identi ﬁed and
used in a LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)
multinomial classi ﬁer, which further reduced the number of features
to a ﬁnal set of 87 genes. Gene coef ﬁcients for each subtype are
available in Supplementary Data 11. Assessing the ﬁnal classi ﬁer in the
ALTTO cohort, we obtained an F1 score (i.e., the harmonic mean ofprecision and recall) macro average of 0.875 and an accuracy of 0.876(cross-validation performance and details are reported in the METH-ODS). The largest discordance was given by 10 samples that werereclassi ﬁed from ERBB2-D to LUM (Supplementary Data 12). As these
two groups were de ﬁned using AIMS (i.e., splitting cluster 4) and not
directly by NMF/k-means, we could expect to have more uncertainty;to explore this, we evaluated the most relevant genes in these sub-types, namely ESR1 andERBB2 . Indeed, a possible explanation for this
d i s c o r d a n c em a yb et h eh i g h e r ESR1 expression levels in samples
reclassi ﬁed from ERBB2-D to LUM compared to the ones concordant
for ERBB2-D (Supplementary Fig. 12).
In ALTTO, the subtypes identi ﬁed with this approach conserved
their biological characteristics compared to the original ones(Supplementary Fig. 13, Supplementary Data 13 and 14) as well as their
prognostic value (Supplementary Fig. 14). In addition to performing
classi ﬁcation, this methodology allows to compute signature scores
for each subtype as a continuous variable as well. At uni- and multi-variable analyses (Supplementary Fig. 15), IM and LUM tumors showedbetter DRFI and OS (multivariable analyses; IM: HR = 0.35; CI,0.19 –0.63; FDR = 0.00051 for DRFI; HR = 0.26; CI, 0.11 –0.61; FDR =
0.0017 for OS; LUM: HR = 0.45; CI, 0.25 –0.81; FDR = 0.0062 for DRFI;
HR = 0.22; CI, 0.08 –0.63; FDR = 0.0018 for OS), while P/Met and Mes/
S tumors presented worse outcomes. Similar results were observed fortheir respective signature scores.
Despite intrinsic challenges related to the applications of classi-
ﬁers across platforms with technical differences and datasets with
potential biases (discussed in the METHODS), the classi ﬁer was able to
detect the HER2-positve subtype s when applied to the selected
external cohorts, with distributions that are shown in SupplementaryFig. 16. The highest proportions of IM tumors were found in I-SPY2 andSCAN-B (24.9% and 23.6%, respectively), while LUM tumors were par-ticularly represented in TCGA (24.4%) and SCAN-B (26.6%).
To assess the robustness of the subtypes, we evaluated whether
their gene expression pro ﬁles as described by hallmark gene sets and
signatures were similar to the original ones in ALTTO. Importantly, inNeoALTTO (Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 15 and 16) as well as in the
other cohorts (Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18, SupplementaryData 17 –24) we observed remarkable similarities, with each subtype
conserving distinct pro ﬁles characterized by the most relevant biolo-
gical features. In addition, in I-SPY2 we compared our subtypesaccording to signature scores and biomarker levels (including micro-array and reverse phase protein array) obtained from Wolff et al.
35.
Immune signatures, with the exception of a mast cell signature, were

liferation signatures, the Mes/S subtype was enriched for an extra-
cellular matrix gene module, luminal signatures were higher in LUM,
and the “HER2ness ”signatures35mainly characterized the ERBB2-D
subtype (Supplementary Fig. 19, Supplementary Data 25). Overall, themain biological features of the HER 2-positive subtypes were main-
tained in different datasets, suggesting the robustness of our ﬁndings,and providing a proof-of-concept for the identi ﬁcation of our subtypes
in other cohorts.

their prognostic value outside of ALTTO. As we initially focused on the
occurrence of distant relapse and overall survival in ALTTO, we eval-uated endpoints including distant relapse-free interval/survival and OS
whenever available. In addition, we evaluated their ability to predict
pCR in the neoadjuvant NeoALTTO and I-SPY2 trials.
In NeoALTTO, event-free survival (EFS, median follow-up of 6.7
years) was signi ﬁcantly different across subtypes, both in the whole
RNA sequencing cohort (log-rank Pvalue = 0.0073) and, interestingly,
in the subgroup not achieving pCR (ypT0/is; log-rank Pvalue = 0.014)
(Fig. 4a, b). Signi ﬁcant differences in terms of OS were observed as well
(Supplementary Figs. 20a, b). In particular, IM tumors presented betteroutcomes compared to the other subtypes, followed by LUM. Of note,IM and ERBB2-D tumors presented higher pCR rates (42.9% and 51.7%,respectively), while only 9.6% of the LUM tumors achieved pCR(Fig. 4c). Rates of pCR by arm are reported in Supplementary Fig. 20c
and suggest a sensitivity to dual HER2 blockade for IM and ERBB2-D
tumors, even though the small numbers demand cautious interpreta-tion. Uni- and multi-variable analyses for EFS and pCR con ﬁrmed these
results, while results for OS were not signi ﬁcant after adjusting for
multiple tests, possibly due to the lower number of events observedfor OS compared to EFS (Supplementary Fig. 21). Moreover, in the 233/
254 patients with TILs data available, IM tumors, as expected, pre-sented higher TILs as compared to other tumors, while lower TIL levels
were observed in the Mes/S subtype (Fig. 4d).
Differences in sensitivity to neoadjuvant treatments were con-
ﬁrmed in the I-SPY2 cohort. Indeed, IM and ERBB2-D tumors presented
pCR rates of 67.2% and 72.4%, respectively, while the LUM subtypeachieved pCR in 20.4% of the cases (Supplementary Fig. 22a). Theassociation of IM, ERBB2-D, and LUM subtypes with pCR was furtherconﬁrmed at uni- and multi-variable analyses (Supplementary Fig. 23).
Responses by subtype and treatment arm are reported in Supple-mentary Fig. 22b, and although these results are purely descriptive dueto the small numbers in each arm, we noticed interesting signalspointing toward high activity of T-DM1 + pertuzumab in IM and ERBB2-D, as well as of paclitaxel + pertuzumab + trastuzumab in P/Met and
ERBB2-D. Intriguingly, all the three patients with Mes/S tumors who
received the antiangiogenic compound AMG 386 achieved pCR.
The prognostic effect of the HER2-positive subtypes was con-
ﬁrmed in the SCAN-B study, when evaluating in the whole population
RFI (log-rank Pvalue = 0.00049), DRFI (log-rank Pvalue = 0.002), and

OS (log-rank Pvalue < 0.0001) (Supplementary Fig. 24a –c), as well as
when limiting the analysis to the subgroup receiving anti-HER2 treat-ment (Supplementary Fig. 24d-f). In particular, IM tumors presented abetter prognosis compared to the others, whereas P/Met tumors had
the worse outcome, as also shown in the uni- and multi-variable ana-
lyses (Supplementary Fig. 25).
Similarly, IM and LUM tumors presented better prognosis in the
METABRIC dataset when evaluating OS, despite the lack of anti-HER2therapy
36(Supplementary Fig. 26 and 27). In TCGA, no progression-
free interval (PFI) events were observed in IM tumors (SupplementaryFig. 28a), but the low total number of events (12/131 patients) precludesreliable analyses in this regard. In addition, the TIL regional fraction
38
(available for 113/131 patients) was higher in IM tumors compared tothe rest of the subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 28b), con ﬁrming the
ability of the IM subtype to capture immune-in ﬁltrated tumors.
Finally, we compared the clinicopathological characteristics
across the ﬁve subtypes in each study (Supplementary Data 26 –30,
also showing the clinicopathological characteristics of each one of theevaluated cohorts). Of note, the differences in hormone receptor sta-tus, with LUM tumors being predominantly (>90%) characterized byhormone receptor-positive tumors, were found across all cohorts.Distributions of intrinsic subtypes were also similar to those in ALTTO,with LUM tumors being mostly Luminal A/B, and ERBB2-D includingalmost exclusively HER2-E.
Since speci ﬁcc l a s s e sw e r ei d e n t i ﬁed in METABRIC, namely inte-
grative clusters (IntClust), and I-SPY2, namely Immune+ and DNA
repair de ﬁciency (DRD)+, we also evaluated their distribution across
theﬁve HER2-positive subtypes (Supplementary Data 29 and 30).
In METABRIC, IntClust subtypes were identi ﬁed in a large cohort
of breast cancers including HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive,and triple-negative tumors
36,39. As expected, all subtypes were pri-
marily enriched for IntClust 5 (including ERBB2 -ampli ﬁed cancers36),
while 19.2% of LUM tumors were classi ﬁed as IntClust 1 (including
mainly estrogen receptor-positive tumors36), 23.1% of IM as IntClust 4
(characterized by immune signatures36), and 11.4% of P/Met as IntClust
10 (mainly basal-like tumors characterized by genomic instability36),
showing some overlap with the HER2-positive subtypes.
In I-SPY2, the majority of IM tumors, although not all of them,
were Immune+ (85.2%), suggesting a large overlap between the twoclassi ﬁcations. Interestingly, 22.4% of P/Met tumors were DRD+, sug-
gesting that at least some of those HER2-positive breast cancers mayhave a phenotype suggestive of DNA repair de ﬁciency.
Of utmost importance, these results showed the prognostic value
of the subtypes across different cohorts. In addition, the subtypes havethe potential to predict response to neoadjuvant anti-HER2 treat-ments, with LUM tumors having lower pCR rates, while ERBB2-D andIM tumors showed higher chance of achieving pCR.
Discussion
HER2-positive breast cancer is characterized by remarkable hetero-geneity in terms of response to anti-HER2 therapies, clinical outcomes,as well as molecular pro ﬁles
17,34,40. In the last years, numerous efforts
have been made to identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers inthis disease, leading to an ongoing evolution of the treatmentlandscape
15,41. In this regard, multiparametric tests such as HER2DX
represent a novelty16. While such research efforts represent remark-
able steps in the direction of a potential clinical application, at thecurrent stage we lack granularity when describing molecular processeswhich could guide development of novel treatment approachesbeyond the identi ﬁcation of prognostic/predictive categories.
In the present study, we highlighted different biological features
associated with distant recurrence and overall survival in a case-control cohort from the trastuzumab-only arm of the ALTTO phase IIIadjuvant trial. In particular, we identi ﬁed 5 prognostic HER2-positive
subtypes depicting both tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmentcharacteristics, namely immune-enriched (IM), luminal (LUM), pro-
liferative/metabolic-enriched (P/Met), mesenchymal/stroma-enriched(Mes/S), and ERBB2-dependent (ERBB2-D). By developing a geneexpression-based classi ﬁer to identify these sub types, we validated our
ﬁndings in external cohorts, including the NeoALTTO phase III trial,
SCAN-B, I-SPY2, TCGA, and METABRIC. Of note, the HER2-positivesubtypes presented consistent gene expression pro ﬁles as well as
clinical characteristics across the cohorts, and retained their prog-nostic value. In particular, IM tumors presented the best outcome in allcohorts, followed by the LUM subtype. A predictive role beyond clin-icopathological features was also shown in the neoadjuvantNeoALTTO and I-SPY2 cohorts, particularly for the LUM and ERBB2-Dsubtypes, associated respectively with lower and higher pCR rates, aswell as for IM tumors, which presented high pCR rates. In considera-tion of their different biology and sensitivity to neoadjuvant therapies,
the HER2-positive breast cancer subtypes (main features summarized
in Fig. 5)m a yb e n e ﬁt from tailored treatment approaches. This is
relevant, as similar clinical outcomes can be explained by differentbiological pro ﬁles associated with distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities.
The predictive and prognostic effects of immune-related features
have been addressed extensively in the last years
16,19,21–25,42.I nf a c t ,p a r t
of the activity of anti-HER2 therapies is mediated by the immune sys-tem, for instance through the activation of antibody-dependent cel-lular cytotoxicity
43. IM tumors, regardless of pCR, presented excellent
outcome in NeoALTTO and may avoid escalation with post-operativeT-DM1 in case of residual disease at surgery
14, sparing patients from
potentially unnecessary toxicities. While several immunotherapeutic
approaches are under development in this disease44,45, we may hypo-
thesize a role for immune-checkpoint inhibitors in combination withHER2-targeting agents for IM tumors, for instance in the context ofchemo-free treatment strategies.
In addition, intrinsic molecular subtype studies showed that
luminal HER2-positive tumors present good prognosis
16,20,21,30,46,w h i l e ,
conversely, having a negative impact on pCR16,19,20,46.I n d e e d ,L U M
tumors, given the low probability of achieving pCR, may not bene ﬁt
from further treatment escalation, particularly in the neoadjuvantphase. However, we could hypothesize that extended adjuvant endo-
crine treatment
47or the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with
hormonal therapy and trastuzumab48,49may be reasonable approaches
to be tested in patients with LUM HER2-positive/hormone receptor-positive tumors. Interestingly, while hormone receptor status is animportant strati ﬁcation factor in HER2-positive breast cancer, a lumi-
nal phenotype is not the predominant characteristic of all hormonereceptor-positive tumors. In fact, not all hormone receptor-positivetumors were classi ﬁed as LUM, whereas almost the totality of LUM
tumors was hormone receptor-positive.
Following the results of the APT trial, adjuvant paclitaxel in
combination with trastuzumab is now the preferred regimen for small,
node-negative tumors directly undergoing surgery, which present
excellent prognosis

explored in tumors presenting favorable biology (e.g., IM or LUMtumors) beyond clinical staging, particularly in consideration of thelow response to neoadjuvant treatments for the LUM subtype. De-escalation approaches driven by treatment response, such as the oneevaluated in the PHERGain trial
51, could also further bene ﬁt from
integrating the tumor biology into the algorithm.
A key aspect for sensitivity to anti -HER2 treatments is represented
by HER2 signaling, which can be in ﬂuenced by ERBB2 expression and
copy number levels, as well as by mutations in the downstreamproteins
16–20. In this regard, the ERBB2-D subtype, mostly characterized
by HER2 signaling (suggesting “HER2-addiction ”17)a n di n t e r m e d i a t e
proliferation, presented excellent sensitivity to neoadjuvant treat-ments, particularly to double HER2-blockade in NeoALTTO and I-SPY2,although these results are limited by the small number of patients inthe different treatment arms.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54621-3

Importantly, P/Met and Mes/S tumors may represent an unmet
medical need in HER2-positive breast cancer. In line with our ﬁndings,
two clusters, proliferative and EMT-enriched, both associated withpoor prognosis, have been identi ﬁed in a previous analysis of different
breast cancer datasets
52. P/Met tumors are characterized by metabolic
reprogramming53–55, activated by AKT/mTOR and IGF1 signaling56,57,
and proliferation, which is also sustained by the parallel RAS/MAPKtransduction pathway
53,56. Proliferation has been shown to positively
impact response to neoadjuvant the rapies, while, conversely, being
associated with worse survival outcomes16,19,58. These characteristics
could make P/Met tumors exquisitely sensitive to dose-dense che-motherapy in combination to HER2-targeting agents
59,60.F u r t h e r m o r e ,
strategies targeting the complex network of metabolic processes intumor cells are currently under development
56,61, and may represent a
valuable strategy in P/Met tumors together with inhibitors of the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR or MAPK pathways15,62.
Reactive stroma and expression of collagen genes have been
shown to impact sensitivity to adjuvant and neoadjuvant anti-HER2treatments
19,26,27. More in general, the extracellular matrix contributes
to treatment resistance with several mechanisms, including the crea-tion of a physical barrier for therapeutic agents as well as immune cells,and integrin signaling
63. Targeting tumor stroma at different levels
represents a potential approach in Mes/S tumors63,64. For instance, as
angiogenesis is one of the main feat ures of this subtype, treatments
such as AMG 386, tested in I-SPY235, may be worth exploring. More-
over, inhibitors of Notch, Hedgehog, WNT, and TGF-beta could block
cancer-associated ﬁbroblast signaling characterizing these tumors63,64.
Finally, the low proliferation of Mes/S tumors lead us to hypothesize apotential role for de-escalating chemotherapy. A growing area ofinterest is represented by the evaluation of biomarkers for novelantibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which are becoming part of thetreatment algorithm in HER2-positive breast cancer
15.I nt h i sr e g a r d ,
investigating the ef ﬁcacy of ADCs in P/Met and Mes/S tumors is of
particular interest to improve their outcomes and evaluate biomarkersrelated to the microenvironment (e.g., stroma composition and impacton the bystander effect) and tumor cells (e.g., proliferative activity).
Of interest, further studies implementing novel technologies, e.g.,
single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and their
integration
65, have the potential to further dissect the heterogeneity of
this disease and may re ﬁne molecular subtypes depicted by bulk RNA
sequencing. For instance, single-cell data could allow the identi ﬁcation
of coexisting tumor clusters with distinct biological pro ﬁles. More-
over, different compositions in terms of immune cell subpopulationsat the single-cell level may characterize subgroups of IM tumors. Inaddition, spatial transcriptomics, allowing spatial mapping of geneexpression data, may highlight different geographic patterns ofimmune in ﬁltration in IM tumors, or allow a more precise evaluation of
cancer-related processes (e.g., EMT) in different tumor areas of Mes/S
tumors.
Our study presents some limitations. Patients in the case-control
cohort received adjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in thecontext of the ALTTO trial. However, being a high-risk populationenriched for distant recurrence events, at least part of them, accordingto current recommendations
29, could be treated with (neo)adjuvant
trastuzumab in combination with pertuzumab due to their clinicalstage, or, with regards to patients with small and node-negativetumors, following the adjuvant APT regimen. The composition of theALTTO case-control cohort may affect the generalizability of ourﬁndings. Nonetheless, the results obtained in the validation cohorts
explored, presenting a greater variability in terms of staging, showed
robust biological and clinical features associated with the HER2-
positive subtypes. It remains to be evaluated the role of the identi ﬁed
subtypes in the metastatic setting. Moreover, trastuzumab still repre-sents the main backbone of HER2-targeting regimens and constitutes areliable starting point for comparisons. When developing andvalidating the HER2-positive breast cancer subtypes, we encountered
challenges related to the different sequencing platforms and sampletypes (detailed in METHODS), and, at the current stage, the identi ﬁ-
cation of our subtypes lacks a speci ﬁc standardized assay which will
allow prospective validation. Nonetheless, our approach allowed the
identi ﬁcation of the subtypes in different cohorts while retaining their
most relevant characteristics, supporting the robustness of our ﬁnd-
ings and allowing retrospective validation in additional studies. Inaddition, while biological pro ﬁles, as well as observed prognosis and
pCR rates, allow us to hypothesize differential sensitivity to speci ﬁc
treatments across subtypes, this will need speci ﬁc experimental and
clinical validation.
The strengths of the present work consist of the use of a well-
annotated case-control cohort balanced for clinicopathological char-acteristics in the context of the phase III ALTTO trial, and the use of
distant recurrence as endpoint to identify the subtypes. This ensured
the identi ﬁcation of biological features responsible of metastatic
relapse, the most frequent cause of death in patients affected by breastcancer
66. The link between the subtypes and survival outcomes was
indeed con ﬁrmed when exploring the validation cohorts. Moreover,
ourﬁndings are in line with previous studies evaluating biomarkers in
HER2-positive breast cancer, supporting their reliability.
In conclusion, we identi ﬁedﬁve HER2-positive breast cancer
subtypes in ALTTO, unraveling the heterogeneity of this disease interms of molecular pro ﬁles associated with clinical outcome. Of note,
their biological features and clinical behavior were validated in exter-
nal datasets, demonstrating the consistency of our ﬁndings. Additional
validation in cohorts implementing therapeutic interventions includ-ing the use of (neo)adjuvant pertuzumab
12,13or (de-)escalated
regimens8,14,50is warranted. Overall, our results provide the rationale
for the exploration of novel treatment strategies and optimizationapproaches in HER2-positive breast cancer, leveraging the diversebiology of this disease.
Methods
Studies included in the present analysis
The ALTTO trial study design and outcomes have been previously
published6. Brie ﬂy, between June 2007 and July 2011 the ALTTO phase
III clinical trial randomized 8381 patients with primary HER2-positivebreast cancer to receive adjuvant trastuzumab (T), lapatinib (L) or T + Lcombined with chemotherapy, into 4 arms: 52 weeks of T (Arm 1),52 weeks of L (Arm 2), 12 weeks of trastuzumab followed by a 6-weekwashout and 34 weeks of L (Arm 3), and T + L for 52 weeks (Arm 4). Theanti-HER2 therapy could be administered sequentially after the adju-vant chemotherapy (Design 1), concurrently (12 weeks) with a taxaneand after anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Design 2), or con-currently (18 weeks) with docetaxel plus carboplatin (Design 2B). Theprimary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), de ﬁned as the time
from randomization to invasive recurrence at local, regional or distant
sites; contralateral invasive breast cancer; second non-breast malig-nancy; or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included OS,deﬁned as time from randomization to death from any cause and time-
to-distant recurrence, and DRFI, de ﬁned as the time from randomiza-
tion to recurrence at any distant sites (ignoring locoregional recur-rences and second primary cancers). In 2011, due to futility todemonstrate noninferiority of L versus T, the L arm was closed, andpatients free of disease were offered adjuvant T. This led to a mod-iﬁcation of the original statistical plan. Overall, T + L did not sig-
niﬁcantly improve DFS and OS compared to T alone
6,67.I nA L T T O ,
clinical data were collected at Institut Jules Bordet and Frontier Science
Scotland; analyses are based on the on ALTTO Study database with
clinical cutoff date on 1 July 2016.
The phase III NeoALTTO trial randomized 455 HER2-positive early-
stage BC patients to receive neoadjuvant T, L or T + L, and results havebeen previously published
9,68,69. Patients were recruited betweenArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54621-3

January 5, 2008, and May 27, 2010. The primary endpoint was patho-
logical complete response (pCR) de ﬁned as absence of invasive tumor
cells in the breast (ypT0/is), later amended to the absence of invasivetumor cells in the breast and in the axillary lymph nodes (ypT0/is
ypN0). In the present analysis, the original de ﬁnition of pCR (ypT0/is)
is used. Event-free survival (EFS) was a secondary endpoint, de ﬁned as
the time from randomization to the ﬁrst event, including breast cancer
relapse after surgery, second primary malignant neoplasm, and deathwithout recurrence for women who received surgery for breast cancer,or, for those who did not undergo surgery, non-completion ofneoadjuvant therapy due to progressive disease or death during clin-ical follow-up. OS was de ﬁn e da st i m ef r o mr a n d o m i z a t i o nt od e a t h
from any cause.
Ethics committee and relevant health authorities at each partici-
pating site approved the ALTTO and NeoALTTO (Supplementary
Data 31 and 32) studies and all patients provided written informed
consent including future biomarker research in both trials. The currentanalysis has been approved by the TransALTTO scienti ﬁc committee
and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
For NeoALTTO, results from RNA sequencing have been pre-
viously published
19,70. RNA sequencing data and PAM50 subtypes
obtained from frozen tumor samples (RiboZero depletion of riboso-mal RNA) are available for 254 patients out of the 455 patients enrolledin the trial
19, while baseline stromal TILs data are available for 233 out
of the 254 patients22. In NeoALTTO, clinical data were collected at
Institut Jules Bordet and Frontier Science Scotland; analyses are based
on the clinical study database frozen on May 26, 2016.
The I-SPY235, METABRIC36,T C G A34,a n dS C A N - B37studies, includ-
ing their gene expression data, have been previously published and arepublicly available.
In the ongoing, adaptive, randomized phase II neoadjuvant I-SPY2
trial, pCR was de ﬁned as ypT0/is ypN0. For I-SPY2, gene-level
expression microarray data from frozen samples were obtained fromGEO, GSE194040, and clinical data from ref. 35. Probes including non-
available values were removed. HER2-positive tumors were selectedbased on the annotation in the clinical data ( N= 245). Patients affected
by HER2-positive breast cancer in the I-SPY2 study were treated in 6
arms, namely paclitaxel + trastuzumab, T-DM1 + pertuzumab, pacli-
taxel + pertuzumab + trastuzumab, paclitaxel + neratinib, paclitaxel +MK-2206 (an AKT inhibitor) + trastuzumab, paclitaxel + AMG 386 (ananti-angiopoietin peptibody) + tr astuzumab. These treatments were
followed by doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide.
For METABRIC, gene expression microarray data from frozen
samples were downloaded from cBioPortal ( https://www.cbioportal.
org/), and clinical data obtained from ref. 39. Probes including non-
available values were removed. Duplicated genes were selectedchoosing the copy with the highest standard deviation. HER2-positivetumors were selected based on the annotation in the clinical data
(N= 236). Patients in METABRIC did not receive anti-HER2 therapy.
TCGA raw counts (from frozen samples, poly(A) library prepara-
tion) and clinical data were obtained using the R package TCGAbiolinks
(v2.24.3)
71. Raw counts were normalized to transcript per million (TPM)
with the R package IOBR (v0.99.9; function “count2tpm ”)72. Survival
data for TCGA were obtained from ref. 73. Here, we focused on
progression-free interval as suggested in ref. 73, although the analyses
in this dataset were limited by the small number of events recorded,possibly also due to short follow-up time
73. HER2-positive breast can-
cers selected as described in ref. 74(i.e., HER2 score 3+ at immuno-
histochemistry or score 2+ with ampli ﬁcation at ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization), excluding stage IV tumors ( N=1 3 1 ) . T h e T I L r e g i o n a l
fraction (available for 113 out of 131 patients) was obtained from ref. 38,
while PAM50 intrinsic subtypes were obtained from ref. 75.
For SCAN-B, gene expression data from frozen tissue [poly(A)
mRNA76] as Fragments Per Kilobase per Million (FPKM) reads and
clinical data were downloaded from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/yzxtxn4nmd/377. For the present analyses, we included only
the “follow-up ”cohort as described in ref. 37, and HER2-positive
tumors selected based on the annotation in the clinical data ( N=8 1 9 ) .
When speci ﬁed, in SCAN-B FPKM gene expression data were converted
to TPM data using the formula:
TPM =FPKMP
all genes FPKM×1 06ð1Þ
as, for instance, done in ref. 78. In SCAN-B not all patients affected by
HER2-positive breast cancer received anti-HER2 therapies, as reportedin the clinical data.
The ALTTO (NCT00490139), NeoALTTO (NCT00553358), I-SPY2
(NCT01042379), and SCAN-B (NCT02306096) trials are registered athttps://www.clinicaltrials.gov .
Sample collection in ALTTO, selection of the case-control cohort
Patients enrolled in the ALTTO trial had centrally con ﬁrmed HER2
positive (3+ by immunohistochemistry and/or positive by ﬂuorescence
in situ hybridization) invasive breast cancer, following the 2007
American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Patholo-g i s t sg u i d e l i n e st od e ﬁne HER2 positivity
79. Hormone receptor posi-
tivity was determined based on the presence of ≥1% of tumor cells
expressing estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. Out of the 2097patients enrolled in the trastuzumab-only arm of the ALTTO trial, RNAwas extracted for 1357 patients from formalin- ﬁxed paraf ﬁn-embed-
ded (FFPE) tumor cores from surgical samples, in the area with thehighest tumor cellularity as evaluated by a breast cancer specializedpathologist (G.V.). Extraction of genomic material (dual extraction forDNA and RNA using the RecoverAll ™Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit
for FFPE (Life Technologies-Invitrogen ™, Thermo Fisher) was per-
formed at the European Institute of Oncology (Milan, Italy, responsibleG.V.), one of the ALTTO central laboratory, which had access to sam-ples from all countries enrolling patients in ALTTO except USA andChina. Total RNA was quanti ﬁed using the NanoQuant Plate (Tecan). A
case-control approach was adopted to select cases with distant relapseand controls with no relapse, with a 1:2 ratio (Supplementary Fig. 1,showing the CONSORT diagram). In detail, we excluded patients whoreceived neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and with less than 200 ng oftotal RNA available, as well as those who died without presenting arelapse event. After a median follow-up of 6.9 years (clinical cutoff date
on 1 July 2016), a total of 134 patients with distant recurrence and
satisfying these criteria were identi ﬁed. These patients were matched
with a 1:2 ratio to controls who did not develop distant or locoregionalbreast cancer recurrence using the R package MatchIt (v4.4.0)
80
according to tumor size ( ≤2c m ,> 2t o ≤5 cm, >5 cm), nodal status (N0,
N1, N2-N3) and hormone receptor status (positive vs. negative) withexact matching (the “nearest ”matching option was used for study
design —sequential vs. concomitant —and histological grade). A total of
402 patients were selected, with N=1 3 4 c a s e s a n d N=2 6 8 c o n t r o l s
(Supplementary Data 1).
RNA sequencing data processing in ALTTO
RNA sequencing was performed at the BRIGHTcore sequencing facility(Université libre de Bruxelles) using the Illumina Novaseq6000 sequencer according to standard procedures. In detail, startingfrom ≥200 ng of total RNA, strand-speci ﬁc cDNA libraries were con-
structed using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold forIllumina paired-end sequencing (2 × 101 bp), and sequencing per-formed with a target read depth for rRNA-depleted total RNA (Ribo-Zero Gold) of 30 × 10
6reads. Fastq reads were trimmed using
Trimmomatic v0.3981. Transcript (ENSEMBL v98) abundance estimates
were generated by Salmon (v1.5.1)82based on STAR alignment to the
human reference GRCh38/hg38 (using GENCODE v38 for the gene
positions). Duplicated reads (often artifactual due to the low libraryArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54621-3

complexity of many samples, probably arising from the FFPE nature of
the samples) were removed after alignment. The R package tximport
(v1.24.0)83was used to obtain gene-level estimates and transcripts per
million (TPM) expression levels. Samples with less than 1 million of
non-duplicated reads mapping to the transcriptome and/or presenting
a proportion of duplicated reads >80% were considered of low qualityand excluded (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). The genes AC010970.1 ,
AC017002.1 ,FP236383.4 ,FP236383.5 ,FP671120.6 ,FP671120.7 ,a s s o -
ciated with low quality samples were ﬁltered out, and TPM recom-
puted. Thus, RNA sequencing data were obtained for 386 patients outof 402, with no differences in terms of clinicopathological character-istics between the two cohorts (Su pplementary Data 1). Gene counts
were normalized using the variance stabilizing transformation (VST)method (function “varianceStabilizingTransformation ”with option
blind = TRUE from the R package DESeq2
84, v1.36.0), after ﬁltering
genes with low expression (average of counts <10 across samples). A
principal component analysis (PCA) plot on VST normalized genes anda heatmap of the top 500 most variable genes annotated by hormonereceptor status are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2c, d, to depict theability of the gene expression data to capture the biological differencesbetween hormone receptor-positive and negative HER2-positivetumors in the ALTTO case-control cohort. In the heatmap, geneexpression values are centered removing their mean and scaleddividing them by their standard deviation; rows and columns areclustered using Spearman as distance measure and Ward.D2 as clus-tering method.
RNA sequencing data processing in NeoALTTO
Out of the 455 patients enrolled in the NeoALTTO trial, RNA was suc-cessfully sequenced from frozen tumor samples in 254 patients aspreviously described
19. Gene expression data were obtained as
described in ref. 70.B r i e ﬂy, starting from BAM ﬁles, read pairs were
trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.3981,a n dS a l m o nv 1 . 5 . 182was used for
alignment to the human reference GRCh38/hg38 (patch 13), usingGENCODE v38 for the gene positions. The R package tximport
(v1.16.1)
85was used to obtain gene-level estimates and TPM-normalized
gene expression levels. Intrinsic subtypes have been previously
obtained in ref. 19.
Computation of intrinsic subtypes and gene expression sig-
natures, gene set variation analysis, identi ﬁcation of
prognostic genes
Intrinsic subtypes were calculated on TPM gene expression data using
the R package AIMS (Absolute Intrinsic Molecular Subtyping; v1.28.0)31.
A pool of 36 gene expression signatures/single genes (SupplementaryData 3, reporting genes, coef ﬁcients, as well as the sources, i.e., PMID
or Reactome
86) was computed on VST normalized gene expression
data in ALTTO. Gene signature scores were computed as weighted
mean of the genes, using the coef ﬁcients as weights (+1/ −1b a s e do n
the association with the biological process described in the originalpublication, or exact values derived from the original publication).
The hallmark gene sets
87(version 7.4) were downloaded from
MSigDB ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb )w i t ht h eR
package msigdbr (v7.4.1)88and used to perform gene set variation
analysis89(R package GSVA v1.44.2, method “GSVA ”) on the VST nor-
malized gene expression data in ALTTO. The following 8 hallmarksignatures were removed due to the lack of association with tumorprocesses or microenvironment: peroxisome, pancreas beta cells,spermatogenesis, bile acid metabolism, heme metabolism, UVresponse up, UV response down, xe nobiotic metabolism. Gene sig-
natures/GSVA scores were computed in the external datasets following
the same procedure as for ALTTO. For uniformity, gene counts inNeoALTTO and TCGA data were also VST normalized after ﬁltering low
expressed genes. In METABRIC and I-SPY2, gene expression values asobtained from the sources were used for the calculation of genesignature/GSVA scores, while log
2(FPKM + 1) data (adjusted for library
protocol) were used in the SCAN-B dataset.
When comparing genes/signature scores and GSVA results across
the HER2-positive breast cancer subtypes, the values were centered
removing their mean and scaled dividing them by their standard
deviation. Each group was compared with the others (1 group vs. rest).The effect size was obtained by applying a linear regression model, andthePvalues were obtained with a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Pvalues
were adjusted for multiple testing according to Benjamini & Hochbergmethod (i.e., FDR), and considered signi ﬁcant when <0.1 for these
comparisons.
Prognostic genes in ALTTO were identi ﬁed using a multivariable
model for DRFI (see the paragraph “Statistical analyses. ”). Genes sig-
niﬁcant for FDR < 0.05 were considered for non-negative matrix
factorization.
Non-negative matrix factorization and clustering, identi ﬁcation
of HER2-positive breast cancer subtypes
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was performed using the R
package NNLM90(https://github.com/linxihui/NNLM ;v 0 . 4 . 4 ;f u n c t i o n
“nnmf ”) on raw counts of the prognostic genes signi ﬁcantly associated
with DRFI, using the mean Kullback-Leibler divergence as loss functiona n dm e t h o d= “lee”
91.T h e “W”and “H”components obtained were
rescaled so that both the sum of the gene weights/factor and the sumof the factor scores/sample were 1. The number of factors (i.e., ranks)was decided by adapting the method suggested by the Authors of the
NNLM package
90, guiding the choice of the number of ranks via missing
value imputation. In detail, the mean Kullback-Leibler divergence wascomputed on 10% of randomly masked gene expression values (com-paring values imputed by NMF with the real ones) across 50 runs forranks 1 to 8, and identifying the rank in which the improvement of themean Kullback-Leibler divergence (average across the 50 runs) startedto decrease (Supplementary Fig. 29). In addition, we considered the apriori knowledge given by the resul ts from gene expression signature
analysis for DRFI, describing at least three groups of processes asso-ciated with prognosis, i.e., immune signatures, stroma-related sig-natures, signaling/metabolic pathways, and a group of signatures not
associated with DRFI. Overall, we considered the solution with 4 fac-
tors acceptable, and NMF was run on the gene expression matrixincluding all the genes associated with DRFI. K-means clustering(nstart = 1000, k= 4) was performed on the factor scores identi ﬁed by
NMF, allowing the categorization of the samples. Selecting k=4l e dt o
clusters that were representative of the NMF factors. Heatmapsdepicting the NMF gene weights/factor (i.e., feature matrix, “W”
component in NMF) and the factor scores/sample (i.e., coef ﬁcient
matrix, “H”component in NMF, ordered according to k-means clus-
tering) are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8. The clusters were furtherreﬁned into 5 subtypes using the AIMS intrinsic subtype information
(HER2-enriched vs. rest), based on survival differences observed within
cluster 4 (described in the RESULTS section).
Development of a gene expression-based classi ﬁer for the HER2-
positive breast cancer subtypes in ALTTO
In order to validate the subtypes identi ﬁed in ALTTO in other datasets,
we deemed it useful to develop a gene expression-based classi ﬁer. For
this objective, we followed a two-step feature selection. First, differ-ential expression analysis comparing one subtype vs. the rest wasperformed using DESeq2
84on gene-level abundance estimates from
Salmon (functions “DESeqDataSetFromTximport ”and “DESeq ”), after
ﬁltering genes with very low expression (sum of the reads across all
samples <10), and specifying “alpha = 0.01 ”in the function “results ”.
The “lfcShrink ”function was used to perform log 2(fold change)
shrinkage according to the “ashr ”method92. Genes were considered
signiﬁcantly differentially expressed for FDR < 0.01, and selected
for the next step when |log 2(fold change)| >1.5 (see paragraphArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54621-3
Nature Communications |        (2024) 15:10402 11
“Cross-validation of the procedure to develop the gene expression-
based classi ﬁer.”). To ensure that genes selected in ALTTO were pre-
sent in the external validation cohorts, we further ﬁltered genes in
common across all other cohorts, excluding all genes with a median
TPM equal to 0 in ALTTO, NeoALTTO, TCGA, median TPM (obtained
from FPKM) equal to 0 in SCAN-B (considering separately the threedifferent library protocols, i.e., dUTP, NeoPrep, and TruSeq) and withmissing values in METABRIC and I-SPY2. This choice was also moti-vated by the application of a methodology relying on the medianvalues of each gene in the different cohorts to apply the classi ﬁer, as
explained in the following section. A total of 365 genes were retainedto develop a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)multinomial classi ﬁer, using the R package caret (v6.0-93). This type of
model was chosen as it allows to both classify samples as well as toc o m p u t eg e n es i g n a t u r e su s i n gt h ec o e f ﬁcients provided by the LASSO
model. Several steps were taken to reduce over ﬁtting.
In detail, the classi ﬁer was developed in the whole cohort starting
from log
2(TPM + 1) gene expression values in ALTTO, using a 10-
fold × 10 times cross validation (train and test sets strati ﬁed for the
subtypes). In the caret function “trainControl ”,w es p e c i ﬁed the
options selectionFunction = “oneSE ”(which lead to the selection of the
simplest model within one standard error of the optimal one, aiming toreduce the probability of over ﬁtting); sampling = “smote ”(an hybrid
sampling method to ensure balance of the classes
93in the training
sets); and classProbs = TRUE. A grid of 100 lambdas was used in the“expand.grid ”function with alpha ﬁxed at 1 (LASSO penalty), and the
best lambda was chosen based on the F1 score measure (de ﬁned as the
harmonic mean between precision and recall, and computed from withthe R package MLmetrics v1.1.1, speci ﬁed in the “trainControl ”function)
during the repeated cross validation procedure. In the caret “train ”
function we speci ﬁed the options method = “glmnet ”,f a m i l y= “mul-
tinomial ”,t y p e . m e a s u r e= “class ”, type.multinomial = “grouped ”
(which applies a grouped LASSO penalty to the variables), intercept =FALSE, and preprocessing included centering by the mean and scalingby the standard deviation.
The mean and standard deviation values (in ﬂuenced by the smote
s a m p l i n g )a sw e l la st h ec o e f ﬁcients assigned to each gene for the ﬁve
subtypes were extracted from the ﬁnal model, to allow the application
of the classi ﬁer in ALTTO as well as external cohorts. For this aim,
signature scores are computed for each subtype as weighted mean ofthe genes, using the coef ﬁcients derived from LASSO as weights, and
the subtypes are assigned based on the highest value.
Validation of the classi ﬁe rf o rH E R 2 - p o s i t i v eb r e a s tc a n c e rs u b -
types in external cohorts
As the subtypes were identi ﬁed from genes associated with the risk of
metastatic recurrence in ALTTO, the step concerning the externalvalidation was necessary to validate and explore in different cohorts
their prognostic/predictive values and biological pro ﬁles. Gene
expression data can be in ﬂuenced by several technical aspects,
including type of sample (e.g., FFPE vs. fresh frozen), method of RNAselection (e.g., poly(A) enrichment vs. ribosomal RNA depletion)
94,95,
and technological platform (e.g., RNA sequencing vs. microarray).Indeed, in-silico validation of classi ﬁcation methods can be challenging
due to these technical hurdles. Moreover, identifying stable subtypeswithin a tumor type is not trivial, and the several, only partially over-lapping, triple-negative breast cancer classi ﬁcations described in the
years are an example of this
96–99.
Coefﬁcients of the LASSO model are relative to the magnitude of
the gene expression values, and can therefore be sensitive to technical
differences. In an attempt to minimize these differences, we imple-
mented a methodology suggested by Bush et al.100, i.e., the ratio-based
correction on TPM gene values. This approach assumes that differ-ences in the expression values across platforms may be related bytechnical factors (poly(A) vs. ribosomal RNA depletion in the case ofthe original publication
100). We extended this concept to make gene
expression values more comparable across the different datasets, tocompute the HER2-positive subtypes. In detail, we calculated themedians of the TPM values of the genes of interest (included in the
classi ﬁer) in ALTTO, as well as the median of the same genes in each
one of the evaluated validation cohorts [TPM in NeoALTTO and TCGA,TPM converted from FPKM in SCAN-B (considering the differentlibrary protocols separately, which were merged after the ratio-basedcorrection), intensities in METABRIC and I-SPY2 after reversed log
2
transformation, i.e., 2^gene expression values]. In each sample, werescaled the value of the genes of interest using the following formula:
gene A valuesample =gene A medianALTTO
gene A mediannew cohort×gene A original valuesample
ð2Þ
where “sample ”belongs to “new cohort ”.
Next, a log 2(“new value ”+ 1) transformation was applied. This
framework ensures that the median of each gene is comparable across
studies, making the application of the LASSO coef ﬁc i e n t s ,a sw e l la st h e
following standardization using the mean and standard deviationderived from the LASSO model, more reliable. However, despite thistransformation, microarray data have a more limited dynamic rangecompared to RNA sequencing
101. Therefore, for METABRIC and I-SPY2
we opted to perform standardization using the mean and standarddeviation computed in each one of these two cohorts. After standar-dization, the signature scores for each subtype are computed asdescribed in the previous section (i.e., as weighted mean of the genes),a n ds u b t y p e sa s s i g n e db a s e do nt h eh i g h e s tv a l u e .
We acknowledge that this methodology has some limitations.
Without having a ground-truth in external datasets, we could not avoid
the well-known issue of test set bias related to the normalizationrequired to reduce platform-speci ﬁc artifacts
102. In our case, this can
impact the median values of each gene in each cohort, which could beinﬂuenced by the composition of the cohort; moreover, we assume
that differences in gene expression levels across platforms/conditions(e.g., use of poly(A)/ribosomal depletion, RNA sequencing/microarray,FFPE/fresh-frozen) are mostly related to technical factors, while dif-ferences in biological aspects may also play a role. Despite theseaspects, the robustness of our ﬁndings suggests that the process is
able to detect subtypes with consistent features across different
cohorts.
The classi ﬁer, including the procedure for median-ratio gene
transformation and appropriate standardization based on the plat-form, is implemented in an R function available at https://github.com/
BCTL-Bordet/HER2_subtypes , which allows the identi ﬁcation of our
subtypes in HER2-positive breast cancer cohorts with gene expressiondata available.
Cross-validation of the procedure to develop the gene
expression-based classi ﬁer
In order to evaluate the performance of the procedure to build the
gene expression-based classi ﬁer on unseen data, we performed a
tenfold cross-validation of the whole process, including the differentialexpression analysis between the subtypes and the development of theLASSO classi ﬁer. In detail, we split the ALTTO dataset into 10 folds
(train and test sets), strati ﬁed by subtype composition. Each train set
was again divided into an inner train and validation set recapitulatingthe procedure to develop the LASSO classi ﬁer in the whole cohort, and
used to tune the best lambda in each fold, with the same criteriadescribed for the whole cohort. In each fold, after differentialexpression analysis performed in the train set, genes with FDR < 0.01 aswell as median TPM > 0 in both the train and corresponding test set
were retained, together with the set of genes present in the external
datasets as described in the paragraph “Development of a geneArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54621-3
Nature Communications |        (2024) 15:10402 12
expression-based classi ﬁer for the HER2-positive breast cancer sub-
types in ALTTO ”. For differential expression, we tested different |
log2(fold change)| thresholds (i.e., 0.585, 1, 1.5, and 2) and compared
with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test metrics obtained in the 10 test sets
(thus, in a total of 40 test sets), namely F1 score macro average,
F1 score weighted average, balanced accuracy average (those threecomputed as average across the 5 subtypes), and accuracy. For allmetrics, no differences were noted between the |log
2(fold change)|
thresholds 0.585, 1, and 1.5, while for a |log 2(fold change)| >2 the per-
formance was signi ﬁcantly lower (Supplementary Fig. 30).
For |log 2(fold change)| >0.585, >1, >1.5, >2, respectively, the mean
(computed across the 10 folds) F1 score macro averages (across sub-types) were 0.72 (CI, 0.68 –0.77), 0.7 (CI, 0.67 –0.74), 0.69 (CI,
0.64 –0.74), and 0.54 (CI, 0.5 –0.58); mean F1 score weighted averages
were 0.74 (CI, 0.69 –0.78), 0.72 (CI, 0.69 –0.75), 0.71 (CI, 0.66 –0.75),
and 0.56 (CI, 0.53 –0.6); mean balanced accuracy averages were 0.83
(CI, 0.81 –0.86), 0.82 (CI, 0.8 –0.84), 0.81 (CI, 0.79 –0.84), and 0.72 (CI,
0.7–0.75); and mean accuracies were 0.73 (CI, 0.68 –0.78), 0.71 (CI,
0.68 –0.74), 0.69 (CI, 0.65 –0.74), and 0.55 (CI, 0.51 –0.58). The solution
ﬁltering differentially expressed genes by |log
2(fold changes)| >1.5 was
chosen as it provided comparable performance with respect to solu-tions using lower thresholds (which would start from a higher numberof genes with smaller differences between groups), as we hypothesizedthat reducing the number of genes used to train the LASSO modelwhile selecting the ones with large differences across groups couldfacilitate the classi ﬁcation of samples in other cohorts, potentially
reducing over ﬁtting related to the selection of genes with closer
expression values between subtypes in ALTTO and improving thegeneralization of the model.
Statistical analysis
The Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Stu-dies (REMARK) criteria were followed for this study
103.
Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models
were used for survival analyses. In univariable analysis, Pvalues
were obtained with the likelihood ratio test. For multivariable analyses,Pvalues were derived by an ANOVA on nested Cox models. For survival
analyses aimed at exploring the role of intrinsic subtypes, gene sig-
natures and selecting the prognostic genes for NMF in ALTTO, wecontrolled for tumor size ( ≤2 cm vs. >2 cm), nodal status (N0 vs. N+),
hormone receptor status, age, timing of chemotherapy (sequential vs.concomitant), grade (3 vs. rest), and, in analyses not evaluating AIMSintrinsic subtypes, AIMS HER2-enriched vs. others.
When evaluating the prognostic value of the HER2-positive sub-
types and their signature scores in ALTTO and in the external cohorts,multivariable analyses were performed controlling for age (not avail-able for I-SPY2), tumor stage (T1 vs. rest in ALTTO, METABRIC, TCGA,SCAN-B; T2 vs. rest in NeoALTTO; not available for I-SPY2), nodal status
(N0 vs. rest; not available for I-SPY2), grade (G3 vs. rest; not available
for I-SPY2 and TCGA), hormone receptor status, treatment receivedwhen the information was available (trastuzumab + lapatinib vs. singleagents in NeoALTTO; anti-HER2 vs. no anti-HER2 in SCAN-B; treatmentarms in I-SPY2).
For pCR analyses in NeoALTTO and I-SPY2, logistic regressions
were used, and when performing multivariable analyses Pvalues were
derived by an ANOVA on nested logistic models.
For continuous variables, hazard ratios/odds ratios and con-
ﬁdence intervals in the forest plots were computed after centering the
variable by removing its mean and scaling by dividing the variable byits standard deviation. Multivariable analyses were performed on
patients with all variables included in the analysis available.
Wilcoxon rank sum (for comparisons between two groups) and
Kruskal-Wallis (for comparisons between three or more groups)tests were used to compare continuous variables according to cate-gorical variables. Fisher ’s test was performed to compare categoricalvariables. Correlations were assessed by calculating the Spearman ’s
rank correlation coef ﬁcient on pairwise complete observations, and
considered signi ﬁcant for P<0 . 0 5 .
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to represent survival
outcomes according to categories (i.e., clusters, HER2-positive sub-
types), and Pvalues obtained with log-rank test.
AllPvalues were two-sided. False discovery rates were obtained
adjusting Pvalues with the Benjamini & Hochberg method, whenever
speci ﬁed.Pvalues were considered signi ﬁcant when <0.05, FDR sig-
niﬁcance levels were determined as speci ﬁed for each analysis. All
conﬁdence intervals are 95%. In box plots, the boxes are de ﬁned by the
upper and lower quartile, the median is shown as a bold horizontal lineand whiskers extend to the most extreme data point which is no morethan 1.5 times the interquartile range from the box. In bar plots, theerror bars represent the 95% con ﬁdence interval.
All statistical analyses were performed using the R software
(v4.2.1)
104. The analyses in the present manuscript were performed at
the Institut Jules Bordet/Université Libre de Bruxelles.

Code availability
The procedure to apply the classi ﬁer for the HER2-positive molecular
subtypes described in the present paper (starting from TPM/FPKM/microarray data) has been implemented in an R script available athttps://github.com/BCTL-Bordet/HER2_subtypes . The R script allows
to compute the molecular subtypes in HER2-positive breast cancercohorts with RNA sequencing or microarray data available. Please notethat our molecular classi ﬁcation was developed, applied and tested in
HER2-positive breast cancer as de ﬁned by immunohistochemistry and
ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization criteria, including both hormone
receptor-positive and negative tumors. Therefore, please selectcohorts of HER2-positive breast cancer according to such criteriabefore computing the molecular subtypes with our classi ﬁer.

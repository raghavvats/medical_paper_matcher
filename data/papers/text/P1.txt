Background and aims: To examine the effect and safety of high-dose green tea extract ( Epigallocatechin
gallate , EGCG) at a daily dosage of 856.8 mg on weight reduction and changes of lipid pro ﬁle and obesity-
related hormone peptides in women with central obesity.
Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identi ﬁer
no. NCT02147041. A total of 115 women with central obesity were screened at our clinic. 102 of them witha body mass index (BMI) /C2127 kg/m
2and a waist circumference (WC) /C2180 cm were eligible for the study.
These women were randomly assigned to either a high-dose green tea group or placebo group. The total
treatment time was 12 weeks. The main outcome measures were anthropometric measurements, lipidproﬁles, and obesity related hormone peptides including leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, and insulin.
Results: Signiﬁcant weight loss, from 76.8 ±11.3 kg to 75.7 ±11.5 kg (p ¼0.025), as well as decreases in
BMI (p ¼0.018) and waist circumference (p ¼0.023) were observed in the treatment group after 12
weeks of high-dose EGCG treatment. This study also demonstrated a consistent trend of decreased totalcholesterol, reaching 5.33%, and decreased LDL plasma levels. There was good tolerance of the treatment
among subjects without any side effects or adverse events. Signi ﬁcantly lower ghrelin levels and elevated
adiponectin levels were detected in the study group than in the placebo group.Conclusion: 12 weeks of treatment with high-dose green tea extract resulted in signi ﬁcant weight loss,
reduced waist circumference, and a consistent decrease in total cholesterol and LDL plasma levels
without any side effects or adverse effects in women with central obesity. The antiobestic mechanism ofhigh-dose green tea extract might be associated in part with ghrelin secretion inhibition, leading toincreased adiponectin levels.

1. Introduction
Obesity has become a global health issue due to its alarmingly
high and increasing prevalence rate worldwide [1]. According to
estimates, around 12% of adults over the age of 20 were obese in
2008; this is nearly double the incidence estimated in 1980 [2].
Various studies have reported that obesity is a major risk factor for
several debilitating and potentially fatal diseases like cardiovascu-
lar disease, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, which lead to
enormous health-care expenditure in many developing anddeveloped countries [3e5]. Thus, strategies and policies for pre-
vention and treatment of obesity have been deemed global prior-ities to reverse the trend of the global obesity epidemic [1].
Numerous anti-obesity interventions have been studied
including lifestyle modi ﬁcation, behavioral therapy, pharmaco-
logical treatments, and surgery [6,7] . However, the limited ef ﬁcacy
and high incidence of adverse events with side effects observed in
conventional therapies have motivated practitioners to investigate
complementary and alternative medicine therapies for weight loss
such as dietary supplements, herbal products, and acupuncture
[8,9] . Green tea ( Camellia sinensis ), one of the most popular bev-
erages in Asia [10], has been studied extensively for its bene ﬁcial
effects on cardiovascular [11] and metabolic diseases [12].The
main components of green tea include catechins, such as Epi-
gallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin, Epicatechin gallate ,*Corresponding author. Institute of Traditional Medicine, National Yang-Ming

and epicatechin, which have been shown to be bene ﬁcial to hu-
man health [10]. Among the above catechins, EGCG is the most
abundant green tea catechin and is considered the most bioactive
component for reducing body weight, which it accomplishes by
decreasing adipocyte differentiation and proliferation during
lipogenesis [13].
However, equivocal results have been reported on the anti-
obestic effects of green tea [10]. On the one hand, Basu et al. [14]
demonstrated that green tea extracts and beverages could cause
reduction of body weight and body mass index in obese subjects in
8 weeks. On the other hand, in our previous study [15] we found
that daily consumption of green tea extract containing 491 mg of
catechins (302 mg EGCG) did not produce weight reduction in
obese women, although signi ﬁcantly decreased plasma cholesterol
and triglycerides were observed. Therefore, in this study we
increased the concentration of EGCG to a daily dosage of 856.8 mg
to examine the antiobestic effect of higher dosages of EGCG and to
examine the effect of high-dosage GTE on obesity-related hormone
peptides.
2. Method2.1. Study design and participants
This was a single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind study
conducted from March 2012 to March 2014 at Taipei City Hospital
in Taiwan. The inclusion criteria for this study was as follows: (1)
women between the age of 20 and 60 years-old, (2) body mass
index (BMI) /C2127 kg/m
2, (3) waist circumference (WC) /C2180 cm, and
(4) willingness to ﬁll out the questionnaires for this trial. Subjects
with the following conditions were excluded: (1) heart failure,
acute myocardial infarction, or stroke in the past year; (2) impaired
liver and kidney function (serum alanine transaminase >80 U/L,
serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dl); (3) breast feeding or pregnancy; (4)
medicinally controlled endocrine disease (thyroid disease, pituitary
disease, diabetes mellitus, etc.); and (5) any other conditions
making the subject unsuitable for the trial, as evaluated by a
physician. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared. We set the BMI cutoff value for obese as /C21
27 kg/m2according to different metabolic responses to BMI across
ethnicities.
Letters were sent to all the patients to explain the purpose of the
study and to invite them to participate. A detailed explanation of
the study design was given to the subjects before participating in
this trial. Finally, 92 subjects were enrolled with written informed
consent. The protocol was approved by the Human Ethics Com-
mittee of Taipei City Hospital and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT02147041).
2.2. Randomization and blindness
Subjects were randomly allocated to one of two arms for 12
weeks ( Fig. 1 ) using a computer, which generated a random num-
ber from 0.0 to 0.99. The subjects given a random number between
0.00 and 0.49 were assigned to group A to receive decaffeinated
GTE, and subjects given a number between 0.50 and 0.99 wereassigned to group B to be given cellulose as a placebo treatment.
Both decaffeinated GTE and cellulose were packed in the same
opaque capsules for blinding. Treatments were administered by a
blinded research assistant. The patients were told not to receive
other types of obesity management and maintain their former diet,
eating habits, and physical activity. Subjects were also told to take
the record of their meals and physical activities every week and
sent back to our assistant to make sure that their diet components
compared to their former diet didn't differ much, so as physicalactivities. Regular consumption of other food and beverages con-
taining caffeine dosage greater than 200 mg per day and health
supplementary containing catechins or polyphenols during the
study period were also prohibited. A list of foods containing cate-
chins, polyphenols, or caffeine and dietary notes were given to each
subject to record down everything they ate daily and monitor their
compliance. All subjects were free to withdraw at any time during
the course of the study.
2.3. Preparation of samples and treatment
The GTE samples, obtained from the Tea Research and Extension
Station, Taiwan, were extracted from dried leaves of green tea. 90
/C14C
pure water was used as solvent to extract from dry green tea leaves
with ratio of tea leaves to solvents 1 to 20 repeatedly for 3 times
with 20 min each time. Then the solvent was cooled down with
catechins preserved by ethylacetate. Catechin-rich extract were
isolated from 50 mL ethylacetate per gram by ceramic membrane
ﬁltration(molecular weight 90) repeatedly for 5 times. Bipolar ion
exchange membrane was applied for decaffeination. The extract is
concentrated under low pressure and temperature, and dried to apowder by spray-drying. Several tea catechins in addition to EGCG
were also standardized in the component analysis of the decaf-
feinated GTE ( Table 1 ). 500 mg of pure microcrystalline cellulose
was capsulized as the placebo, as well as the decaffeinated GTE
extracts capsulized 500 mg each. The treatment frequency for this
trial was three times daily for 12 weeks with one capsule 30 min
after meals. The total daily doses of GTE compounds taken by the
treatment group are listed in Table 1 , with the daily dose of EGCG
amounting to 856.8 mg.
2.4. Outcome measurements
The percent reduction of body weight (BW), BMI, and WC of the
two different treatments were used as major outcome measure-
ments. Accurate and sensitive measurements of body weight and
height were gauged using a standardized electronic beam scale to
the nearest 0.1 kg and a wall-mounted stadiometer to the nearest
0.1 cm, respectively. Waist circumference was de ﬁned as midway
between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest. Arterial blood
pressure was obtained using an electronic digital sphygmoma-
nometer. All measurements were done after an overnight fast and
were performed once at the beginning of the study and once after
12 weeks of treatment.
2.5. Analysis of biochemical data and obesity-related hormone
peptides
At the beginning and end of the study, an experienced nurse
drew whole blood samples from patients the morning after 8 e9h
of fasting to obtain laboratory data including measurements of
blood sugar, plasma lipoproteins (for triglycerides, cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density li-
poprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)), and obesity-related hormone
peptides including leptin, insulin, ghrelin, and adiponectin. The
whole blood sample was centrifuged at 4
/C14C immediately with
15000 rpm for 20 min to separation with a 2 ml aliquot of serum
and rapidly frozen at /C080/C14C for subsequent radioimmunoassay
(RIA) analysis. The biochemical data was analyzed in clinical lab-
oratories at the hospital. The Millipore Human Leptin assay (Mil-
lipore, St. Charles, MO, USA) using I125-labeled human leptin
antiserum with a sensitivity limit of 0.5 ng/ml was used to detect
plasma leptin levels. Plasma ghrelin and adiponectin were detected
using Millipore Ghrelin and Adiponectin RIA Kits (Millipore, St.
Charles) with sensitivity limits of 93 pg/ml and 1 ng/ml,I.-J. Chen et al. / Clinical Nutrition 35 (2016) 592 e599 593
respectively. Plasma insulin levels were measured using a
commercially available RIA (Linco Research, Inc.) with a sensitivity
limit of 0.5 ng/ml. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR) was applied to evaluate insulin resistance
using the following calculation: HOMA-IR ¼insulin (mUI/L)/C2glucose (mmol/L/22.5). Values greater than 2.25 were
considered to indicate insulin resistance [16].
2.6. EGCG dose analysis
For extraction,100 ml of 50% methanol were mixed with the GTE
sample for 10 min. 20 ml of the extracted solution were centrifuged
at 10,000 rpm (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5402, MI, USA) for 10 min. The
supernatant was ﬁltrated with a 0.22-mm syringe ﬁlter (Millipore,
Bedford, MA, USA). Then, 20 ml of the supernatant liquid were
injected into the high performance liquid chromatography(HPLC)
system for further analysis. HPLC analysis was performed by a
Hitachi 7000 series module equipped with a photodiode array
detector with wavelength set at 273 nm. Catechin, epicatechin, and
EGCG were separated from the extract using a Merck Purospher
STAR C-18 (50 /C24.6 mm i.d., 5 mm). The ﬂow rate of the mobile

phase was 0.8 ml/min. All samples were analyzed at room tem-
perature (25/C14C).
2.7. Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 16, Chi-
cago, IL.). All evaluation data are presented as means with their
standard errors. Independent Student's t-tests were employed for
between-group analysis to examine the differences in anthropo-
metric and biochemical characteristics, and obesity-related hor-
mone peptides. Within-group analysis was analyzed by paired t-
tests. All p-values were two-tailed and the alevel of signi ﬁcance
was set at 0.05.
3. Results
Experienced doctors at our outpatient clinic screened 115
women, and 104 subjects who met the inclusion criteria were
invited to participate. Of these, 10 subjects refused to participate,
while two subjects were excluded due to failure to attend study
visits. In the end, 92 subjects were enrolled and were randomly
allocated into either the decaffeinated EGCG group (group A) or the
placebo control group (group B) ( Fig. 1 ). Subjects were asked to
return all packaging and unused capsules to monitor compliance.
Each subject was supposed to take 252 capsules throughout the
treatment, and if the subjects returned more than 14 capsules, they
were considered non-adherent to the protocol. Five subjects in
group A and seven subjects in group B discontinued the study due
to personal reasons. There were two subjects in group A and one
subject in group B who took less than 95% of the capsules and were
thus deemed non-adherent to the protocol requirements. In theend, 77 subjects completed the study without any adverse events
or side effects.
Baseline demographics and measurements including age,
weight, BMI, waist circumference, and hip circumference showed
no signi ﬁcant difference between the two groups ( Table 2 ). Therewas also no signi ﬁcant difference detected between the two groups
in terms of the biochemical factors analyzed including lipid pro ﬁle,
fasting sugar, and obesity-related hormones.
According to the within-group analyses, the body weight of
group A decreased from 76.8 ±11.3 kg to 75.7 ±11.5 kg (p ¼0.025)
after 12 weeks of the EGCG treatment. BMI and waist circumference
were reduced from 31.0 ±3.8 kg/m
2to 30.6 ±3.9 kg/m2(p¼0.018)
and 95.1 ±9.6 cm to 92.8 ±9.8 cm (p ¼0.023), respectively
(Table 3 ). In group B, only waist circumference and hip circumfer-
ence reached signi ﬁcant reduction: from 95.7 ±10.8 cm to
91.5±8.2 cm (p ¼0.017) and 107.2 ±8.7 cm to 103.7 ±6.9 cm
(p¼0.003), respectively. No such difference was observed in
weight or BMI.
From the biochemical data, group A exhibited signi ﬁcantly
decreased cholesterol levels, from 198.8 ±35.9 mg/dL to
183.9 ±34.2 mg/dL (p ¼0.005). A signi ﬁcant reduction in LDL levels
was also detected, from 124.7 ±30.5 mg/dL to 112.1 ±27.0 mg/dL
(p¼0.006). Group B, on the other hand, exhibited an elevation in
LDL levels after the 12-week treatment. No difference was observed
in fasting blood sugar, triglyceride, and HDL levels in group A after
EGCG treatment, whereas HDL levels were signi ﬁcantly reduced in
group B, from 50.8 ±12.2 mg/dL to 46.7 ±10.2 mg/dL. Taken
together, these results suggest EGCG might have a bene ﬁcial effect
on lipid pro ﬁles in obese subjects.
Liver function tests showed a signi ﬁcant increase in alanine
aminotransferase from 27.2 ±14.9 IU/mL to 33.6 ±22.2 IU/mL in
group A, but remained within normal range. No elevation of alanine
transaminase was observed in group B. The hormone peptide
analysis showed signi ﬁcant increases in adiponectin levels for both
groups after 12 weeks: from 20.9 ±11.0 ng/mL to 24.0 ±10.7 ng/mL
in group A and 15.6 ±10.6 ng/mL to 19.8 ±6.4 ng/mL in group B.
However, no differences were found among the other hormone
peptides of leptin, ghrelin, and insulin.
According to the post-treatment between-group analysis, no
signiﬁcant differences were detected in body weight, BMI, or waist
circumference between group A and group B ( Table 3 ).

Unexpectedly, neither lipid pro ﬁles nor fasting blood sugar levels
differed signi ﬁcantly between the post-treatment groups. However,
glycohemoglobin levels from group A were obviously lower in
comparison to group B after treatment but no difference was shownin HOMA-index or insulin. Signi ﬁcantly lower ghrelin levels and
higher adiponectin levels were detected in group A compared to
group B post-treatment.
Percentage reductions between groups in anthropometric
measurements, blood pressure, and laboratory data were also
analyzed ( Table 4 ). The percentage reduction in total cholesterol
levels reached 5.33% with a mean of 11.39 ±21.45 mg/dL in group A.In comparison, group B demonstrated a mean 1.70% elevation in
total cholesterol levels after treatment. No other differences in
percentage reductions were found from anthropometric data,
biochemical data, or obesity-related hormones.
3.1. Side effects
No subjects withdrew from the study because of discomfort or
adverse events associated with the treatment. Three subjects had
mild abdominal discomfort after GTE treatment, and one subject
had abdominal discomfort after cellulose treatment. All theTable 3

4. Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated from within-group analyses that
green tea extract with a high-dose of EGCG (daily dose of 856.8 mg)
was able to not only decrease body weight and BMI in obese
women after a 12-week treatment, but also led to signi ﬁcant
reduction in waist circumference. This is in contrast to the lack of
obvious body weight changes observed in our previous study, in
which the treatment group was taking a lower dose of EGCG
(360 mg daily) than in this study, although a lipid-lowering effect
was observed [15]. When the concentration of EGCG was elevated
to the daily dose of 856.8 mg in this study, it showed a more
favorable effect on anthropometric measurements. This implies
that the effect of EGCG on weight reduction might be dose-
dependent.
The antiobestic effect of green tea has been discussed exten-
sively over the past 10 years [17]. The effect of EGCG on body weight
change in this study agrees with the result of a recent meta-analysis
of 11 trials, which showed an average of 1.51 kg body weight loss in
Asian participants [18]. The mechanisms of green tea extract in
inﬂuencing body weight and body composition have been attrib-
uted to an increase in thermogenesis and fat oxidation [19,20] . This
is accomplished by the caffeine component of green tea through
enhancing sympathetic nervous system activity and regulating
appetite [21], thus decreasing nutrient absorption and enzymes
involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. However, some clinical
studies could not demonstrate this antiobestic effect [10,12] ,
perhaps because of confounding factors of ethnicity, habitual
caffeine consumption, or catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT)
concentration [10]. It is worth noting that the caffeine component
of the GTE in this study was relatively low (daily dose of less than
1.05 mg) compared to other green tea extracts. No obvious side
effects or discomfort from sympathetic system hyperactivity were
noted in our study. Thus, the weight reduction effect noted in this
study seems entirely attributable to the effects of EGCG, which has
been proven to increase fat oxidation through the inhibition of
COMT, an enzyme involved in the degradation of norepinephrine
[22,23] , and through the regulation of lipid-metabolism-related
genes and transcription factor expression [24,25] . One in vivo
study demonstrated EGCG dose-dependent inhibition of lipid
accumulation in maturing preadipocytes [26]. More study is war-
ranted to discover whether dose-dependent effects exist for EGCG
in increasing fat oxidation and lipolysis or suppressing fatty acid
synthesis.
In addition, it is interesting to note that even the placebo group
showed signi ﬁcant body composition change with decreased
waist and hip circumference, albeit without body weight change.
In a study conducted by Du et al., the authors showed that fruit
and vegetables containing high levels of cellulose more than 4 g/
day could lead to waist circumference change without weightreduction, and concluded that higher intake of ﬁber has favorable
effects on preventing abdominal obesity, probably through
reduced total fat intake [27]. With our daily dosage of cellulose
1.5 g in the meal of subjects, the total cellulose amount per day
could easily exceed 4 g. Thus, a possible reason for the lack of
distinct differences in our between-group anthropometric mea-
surement analysis could be that cellulose might also have bene-
ﬁcial effects on weight regulation with increased dosages and
longer duration.
According to the lipid pro ﬁles, total cholesterol as well as low-
density cholesterol levels obviously decreased after 12 weeks ofEGCG treatment. In our previous study, taking 302 mg of EGCG per
day for 12 weeks signi ﬁcantly reduced serum LDL-cholesterol and
triglyceride levels with a marked increase in HDL-cholesterol levels
[15]. However, we did not observe signi ﬁcant changes in triglyc-
eride and HDL blood levels in this study. Our results corroborate
those of Basu et al., who noted in their study that subjects with
metabolic syndrome had a signi ﬁcant decreasing trend in blood
LDL-cholesterol levels and LDL/HDL ratio after taking green tea
extract for eight weeks [14]. The mechanism of the lipid-lowering
effect of EGCG in plasma might be attributable to EGCG interrupt-
ing lipid absorption through competition with enzymes involved in
lipid digestion and absorption [28,29] . Moreover, a dose-dependent
effect of ECGC consumption was demonstrated in another in vitro
study [30]. A meta-analysis conducted by Kim et al. also revealed
that green tea catechins could reduce total cholesterol and LDL
plasma levels without in ﬂuencing HDL cholesterol or triglyceride
levels [31]. Although Christine et al. demonstrated that GTE con-
taining 25% EGCG can inhibit lipolysis of triglycerides and decrease
triglyceride absorption in gastric and duodenal medium in vitro ,
Han et al. failed to observe any inhibitory effect of tea catechins on
pancreatic lipase activity. In this study, the inconsistent results ofEGCG on triglyceride levels might be related to the lower baseline
triglyceride levels noted in this study group compared to our pre-
vious study groups. On the other hand, our subjects were asked to
keep their former diet without any restriction, so perhaps the
fasting and diet components of their lifestyle had a greater impact
on plasma triglyceride levels than EGCG did, potentially leading to
confounding effects. A larger-scale clinical trial or in vitro study is
needed to determine the optimum dose of GTE to achieve healthy
modulation of serum lipids. Surprisingly, signi ﬁcantly decreased
HDL levels along with higher glycohemoglobin levels were also
observed in the cellulose group compared with the GTE group. That
being said, the cellulose group already showed a higher glyco-
hemoglobin concentration compared to the GTE group before
treatment, although this difference did not reach statistical signif-
icance. Therefore, cellulose treatment might not be able to reverse
the trend of exacerbated insulin resistance without diet restriction
or other treatment. According to a previous study, patients with
insulin resistance exhibit increased HDL catabolism, which might
explain the abnormal trend in HDL levels we observed in the cel-
lulose group [32]. The in ﬂuence of cellulose on sugar metabolism
warrants further exploration.
GTE containing a high dose of EGCG was also observed to cause a
signiﬁcant increase in adiponectin levels after EGCG treatment,
mirroring the results of our previous study. We also noted elevated
adiponectin levels after EGCG treatment compared with the pla-
cebo group in the between-group analysis. Adiponectin, a protein
that confers bene ﬁts via its anti-atherogenic and anti-diabetic
properties, has been recognized as a key regulator of insulin
sensitivity and tissue in ﬂammation [33]. Several animal studies
have reported that EGCG can increase adiponectin levels in a dose-
dependent manner by up-regulating adiponectin expression in
mouse preadipocyte cells [34e39]. However, the effect has been
inconsistently replicated in clinical studies. In a study conducted by
Basu et al., daily 400-mg EGCG supplementation for 8 weeks in
obese subjects minimally affected adiponectin levels, which mightbe attributable to the lower dosage of EGCG given and ethnicity
differences in comparison to this study, as well as its lack of a
double-blind design [40].
Contrary to our previous results [15], we detected signi ﬁcantly
lower ghrelin post-treatment in the EGCG group compared to the
placebo group, but without signi ﬁcant changes in leptin levels. It
has been reported that ghrelin levels decrease in humans with
obesity and metabolic syndrome and increase during weight loss,
suggesting it plays a role in energy adaptation [41] andI.-J. Chen et al. / Clinical Nutrition 35 (2016) 592 e599 597
potentially facilita tes weight regain over long-term follow-up
[42]. However, other studi es have revealed th at biliopancreatic
diversion with duodenal switch surgery leads to markedly sup-
pressed ghrelin levels with signi ﬁcant weight reduction and
long-lasting weight-reduction effects [43]. In our study, we
observed signi ﬁcant weight reduction with decreased ghrelin
levels after EGCG treatment compared with the placebo group,
implying that a high dose of EGCG might not only increase en-
ergy metabolism and interrupt lipid accumulation but also
directly inhibit the secretion of ghrelin. There has been no study
to date, in vivo orin vitro , to explain this phenomenon or
mechanism. Thus, a detailed mechanism and clinical implications
should be explored in future studies.
There are some limitations to our study. First, we did not follow
up regularly with these subjects during the study period to
observe weight changes and trends of biochemical data and
obesity-related hormones. Second, the bioavailability of high-dose
EGCG was not investigated in our study. According to Chow's
study [44], system availability of free EGCG increases more than
60% after a high daily dose of EGCG (800 mg of EGCG, once daily).
In contrast, while the daily EGCG intake was similar in the presentstudy (864 mg), it was spread over three doses per day, and
bioavailability in this case of large doses after meals still needs to
be determined. The optimum EGCG dosage and frequency for
obesity control merits more in-depth investigation in further
studies. Third, the duration of our treatment was not long enough
to observe if weight reduction can be induced steadily without any
liver function injury. Liver enzymes were obviously elevated after
GTE treatment, although they remained within the normal range.
Schmidt has reported that EGCG from GTE can induce acute
cytotoxicity in liver cells that help command metabolism in the
human body [45]. Some other case reports also uncovered the
liver toxicity of green tea in the form of self-limited acute hepatitis
and resolved after discontinuation of supplements containing
green tea extract [46e48]. However, the mechanism of the liver
toxicity is still unclear. Further studies are needed to monitor the
optimum dosage that can be administered for obesity control
without patients experiencing adverse effects. Careful monitoring
the liver enzymes during high-dosage of green tea extract may be
warranted. Finally, the placebo group had higher HbA1c and lower
adiponectin levels at baseline, although the difference did not
reach statistical signi ﬁcance. A larger-scale trial should be con-
ducted to reduce sampling bias.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated signi ﬁcant weight loss
and consistent decreases in total cholesterol and LDL plasma
levels after 12 weeks of high-dose EGCG treatment in within-
group analyses with good treatment tolerance among subjects
without any side effects or adverse effects. The antiobestic
mechanism might be partly associated with inhibition of the
secretion of ghrelin, leading to an increase in adiponectin levels.
This should be veri ﬁed with a large-scale study with a longer
follow-up in the future. The bioavailability and pharmacokinetics
of high-dose EGCG in the human body also merits more
exploration.

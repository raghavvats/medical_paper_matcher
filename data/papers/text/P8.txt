1. INTRODUCTION
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with an increased 
risk of morbidity and mortality. To reduce future cardiovas-
cular complications, patients are encouraged to adopt lifestyle 
modifications and undergo pharmacological therapy to prevent 
atherosclerotic complications. Great efforts have been made to 
prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the occurrence of 
adverse events remains a concern, including acute coronary syn-
drome, stroke, revascularization procedures, and cardiovascular 
death. Furthermore, there is particular concern for patients who 
have received coronary angioplasty. Therefore, it is important to 
reduce residual risk in this high-risk population.Abstract
Background: Lifestyle modification is suggested for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but the impact of adherence to 
a healthy lifestyle remains undetermined. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of adherence to a healthy lifestyle 
with future outcomes and biochemical markers in CAD patients.
Methods: The Biosignature CAD study examined 716 CAD patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 
Information was collected on whether these patients adhered to a healthier lifestyle after PCI, including healthy diet, not smoking, 
and exercise. The clinical outcomes included major cardiovascular events and unplanned revascularization procedures, hospitali-
zation for refractory or unstable angina, and other causes
Results: The average follow-up period was 26.8 ± 8.1 months, during which 175 (24.4%) patients experienced at least one event. 
The combination of healthy lifestyle factors was associated with lower risk, and the maximum risk reduction reached 50% (hazard ratio: 
0.50, 95% confidence interval: 0.25-0.99). As the number of healthy lifestyle factors increased, there were decreases in inflammatory 
markers, C-reactive protein, waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (p  < 0.05). The benefits of modifiable healthy lifestyle factors were especially observed in the younger 
population, males, patients with HDL <40 mg/dL, those with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and those receiving statin therapy.
Conclusion: Adherence to a healthy lifestyle is independently associated with a lower risk of future adverse events in CAD patients 
and plays an important role in secondary prevention in the era of interventional cardiology.

Most studies have focused on the effectiveness of pharma-
cological treatment for secondary prevention in the context of 
CAD. Recently, adherence to a healthy lifestyle has attracted 
attention and has been encouraged for primary prevention of 
CVD. Low-risk healthy lifestyle factors have been associated 
with a lower risk of developing cardiovascular events, and the 
combined benefit has been observed in the primary prevention 
for CVD in Caucasian populations.1,2 Such factors include not 
smoking, physical activity, and healthy diet habits. Recently, Lv 
et al3 reported that adherence to healthier modifiable lifestyle 
factors is also associated with a lower CVD burden in primary 
prevention in Chinese individuals. Thus, a healthy lifestyle is 
important for CVD prevention in Asian populations well.
Interestingly, most observations have been on the benefits of 
combined healthy lifestyle factors in primary prevention, but 
there is limited information about their effects in secondary pre-
vention. Furthermore, after coronary intervention, it is recom-
mended that patients receive aggressive medical therapy, such 
as statins and antiplatelet therapy, but the risk of developing 
adverse events remains higher than in the general population. 
Although education for lifestyle modification is usually provided 
for CAD patients in daily practice, the impact of maintaining a 
healthy lifestyle for secondary prevention in stable CAD patients 
has remained undetermined, and the information is limited for 
Asian populations.4,5 Additionally, the relationship between a 
healthy lifestyle and biochemical profiles in CAD patients is also 
unclear.
In the current study, we prospectively examined the joint 
association of healthy lifestyle factors with the future risk of 
adverse cardiovascular events in an Asian cohort of CAD 
patients after coronary intervention – the Taiwan Biosignature 
CAD study.6–9 The long-term cardiovascular outcomes were ana-
lyzed to evaluate whether adherence to healthy lifestyle factors 
are independently associated with reduced risk of future events. 
Our findings could provide real-world evidence of the impact 
of a healthy lifestyle on secondary prevention in CAD patients 
after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
2. METHODS
2.1. Study population
The Biosignature study was a nationwide prospective cohort 
study that was conducted to identify risk factors among CVD 
patients who were in stable condition at baseline.8,9 In brief, 
a series of stable CAD patients were evaluated at nine differ -
ent medical centers located in Northern, Central, Southern, 
and Eastern Taiwan. The patients were evaluated if they had 
a history of significant CAD documented by coronary angio-
gram, a history of myocardial infarction (MI), or a history of 
angina with ischemic ECG changes or a positive response to 
a stress test.
The patients were enrolled according to the following crite-
ria: (1) successful PCI with either coronary stenting or balloon 
angioplasty at least once and (2) stability on medical treatment 
for at least 1 month before enrollment. To collect biochemical 
parameters in stable condition, patients were excluded if (1) 
they had acute-phase cardiovascular events, including hospi-
talization for unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, acute 
MI, acute cerebrovascular events, or other acute cardiovascu-
lar events within 3 months before enrollment; (2) they planned 
to receive further coronary revascularization or interventional 
procedures for another condition in the following year; (3) they 
had significant malignancy or tumors requiring advanced medi-
cal or surgical therapy in the following year; (4) they had other 
major systemic CVDs requiring hospitalization or operation 
in the following year; or (5) they were unable or unwilling to be followed-up in the following year. This study was approved 
by the institutional research boards and ethics committees in 
each hospital. All patients gave written informed consent before 
entering the study.
2.2. Baseline data collection
After enrollment, specially trained study nurses and qualified 
cardiologists collected all data prospectively whenever feasible. 
Baseline characteristics were collected and included risk factors 
such as the history of hypertension, diabetes, smoking habits, 
and medications used. In addition, biochemical profiles were 
recorded, including blood glucose, lipid profile, and renal func-
tion. Dietary information and exercise frequency were deter -
mined at baseline using a structured questionnaire. Healthy 
lifestyle factors were analyzed and included a healthy diet, not 
smoking, and regular exercise habits.
A healthy diet pattern was determined according to the 
guidelines of the American Heart Association and the American 
College of Cardiology on lifestyle management to reduce cardio-
vascular risk.10 These guidelines emphasize an increased intake 
of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, healthy protein 
sources (low-fat dairy products, low-fat poultry (without the 
skin), fish/seafood, and nuts), as well as nontropical vegetable 
oils, along with limited intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened bever -
ages, and red meats. The healthy diet pattern was assessed using 
a food frequency questionnaire according to the recommended 
Food Score developed in 2000 by Kant et al,11 which follows the 
guidelines mentioned.
Nonsmoking status was assigned to those who had never 
smoked or had quit smoking >6 months prior.3 Regular active 
exercise was defined as exercise episodes lasting for at least 30 
minutes and occurring more than five times a week.12 Patients 
without any of these three healthy lifestyle factors were defined 
as the unhealthy lifestyle group. Subjects were evaluated at 
3-month intervals in an outpatient clinic. Subjects with a healthy 
lifestyle were defined as those who adhered to lifestyle factors 
(not smoking, healthy diet, and adequate exercise) during the 
follow-up period for >50% of the time. A similar definition 
of dietary habit adherence has been reported previously.7 The 
information about lifestyle factors was collected and confirmed 
regularly by the same study nurses throughout the follow-up 
period.
2.3. Ethics approval and consent to participate
The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was 
approved by the appropriate Health Authorities, independent 
Ethics Committees, the Joint IRB Ethics Committee Review 
Board in Taiwan, and Independent Review Boards in each 
hospital (Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; 
Cheng-Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; E-Da Hospital, 
Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New 
Taipei City, Taiwan; Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital 
and Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; 
Mackay Memorial Hospital, Mackay Medical College, New 
Taipei City, Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital, 
Taichung, Taiwan; Buddhist Tzu-Chi General Hospital, Tzu-
Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan; National Taiwan University 
College of Medicine and Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan). All 
patients had to provide written informed consent before 
enrollment.
2.4. Clinical follow-up for adverse cardiovascular events
Each patient was initially in stable condition under medi-
cal treatment and was prospectively followed up in individual 
hospital clinics at regular 3-month intervals for at least 1 year 
after enrollment. The development of adverse cardiovascular

events was identified and recorded during follow-up. Such 
events included cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal 
stroke, unplanned revascularization procedures, hospitalization 
for refractory or unstable angina, and hospitalization for other 
causes (including stroke, transient ischemic attack, and periph-
eral arterial occlusive disorder).
MI was confirmed if ischemic symptoms presented with 
elevated serum levels of cardiac enzyme or characteristic ECG 
changes. Coronary revascularization procedures with either PCI 
or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were confirmed by 
reviewing medical records. Stroke was defined as a new neuro-
logical deficit lasting for at least 24 hours with definite image 
evidence of a cerebrovascular accident according to magnetic 
resonance imaging or computed tomography scans. The proto-
col for the follow-up of cardiovascular events was similar to 
those reported in previous studies.8,9,13,14
2.5. Statistics
Data are expressed as the means ± SDs for numerical vari-
ables and as numbers (percentages) for categorical variables. 
Continuous variables were compared between groups through 
an analysis of variance. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust 
for multiple tests. Subgroup comparisons of categorical varia-
bles were conducted using a χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test. Patients 
with event occurrence were compared to those without events. 
A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to esti-
mate the association of individual healthy lifestyle factors and 
joint effects with the risk of future adverse events after adjust-
ing for variables including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), 
hypertension, diabetes, stroke, CAD severity, medications, lipid 
profiles, and inflammatory markers.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Patient characteristics
The study enrolled a total of 716 CAD patients who underwent 
a coronary intervention and had information on lifestyle factors. 
There were 610 (85.2%) male patients, 466 (65.1%) patients 
who had hypertension, 264 (36.9%) patients who had diabetes, 
16 (2.23%) patients who had stroke, and 177 (24.7%) patients 
who had a family history of hypertensive CVD. Table 1 shows 
the patients’ baseline characteristics.
With regard to lifestyle issues, 444 (62%) patients adhered to 
dietary suggestions for CAD patients, including eating low-fat 
diets with more vegetables, fruit, fish, whole grains, and olive oil 
during the follow-up period. Furthermore, 330 (46.1%) patients 
were nonsmokers, and 347 (48.5%) patients had regular exer -
cise habits of at least 30 minutes per day for >5 days per week. 
Pharmacologic treatments included angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers 
(ARBs) (66.2%), β-blockers (58.9%), calcium channel blockers 
(35.9%), diuretics (12.7%), and statins (70.5%).
Table 2 shows the events that occurred in the average follow-
up period of 26.8 ± 8.11 months. A total of 175 (24.4%) of 
the 716 patients experienced at least one event. The major clini-
cal events that occurred during follow-up are summarized in 
Table 2. There were 12 cardiac deaths, 22 nonfatal MIs, and 123 
readmissions for revascularization procedures. Furthermore, 
four patients developed stroke, and 14 patients suffered conges-
tive heart failure.
Table 3 compares the baseline characteristics between those 
who had adverse cardiovascular events and those who did not. 
Patients with events had fewer nonsmokers (35% vs 49%, 
p = 0.001), less active exercise (38.3% vs 51.8%, p  = 0.002), 
less ACE inhibitor/ARB use (60% vs 68%, p  = 0.046),  
and higher rates of triple vessel disease (40.1% vs 27.5%, p = 0.005) and diuretic use (17.7% vs 11.1%,  
p = 0.022). Although the results did not achieve statistical sig-
nificance, patients without events tended to have healthy diet 
habits (63.6% vs 57.1%, p  = 0.127).Table 1

3.2. Effects of healthy lifestyle factors on biochemical and 
inflammatory profiles
Table  4 shows the baseline characteristics, biochemical pro-
files, and inflammatory markers according to the number of 
healthy lifestyle factors adhered to in the study population. 
There was a significant trend of lower serum levels of high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein as the number of healthy lifestyle 
factors increased. Notably, waist circumference, low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and the ratio of total cholesterol 
to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol also decreased 
gradually as the number of healthy lifestyle factors increased 
(p < 0.05) (Fig.  1). The modifiable healthy lifestyle factors 
were associated with improved inflammatory status and bio-
medical profiles with a dosing effect. In addition, patients with 
more healthy lifestyle factors tended to be female and older. 
Regarding CAD severity, although patients without HLF had 
more triple vessel disease, there was no significant difference 
in the number of affected sites of coronary vessels among the 
various HLF groups.
3.3. Effects of healthy lifestyle factors on the risk of future 
cardiovascular events
To further investigate the potential impact of different lifestyle 
factors on future risk, the effects of modifiable healthy lifestyle 
factors were analyzed in all study patients, including healthy 
diet, active exercise, and no cigarette smoking. Table 5 shows 
the combined effects of healthy lifestyle factors in relation to 
the future risk of cardiovascular events adjusted for comorbidi-
ties, age, gender, history of hypertension, diabetes and medica-
tions (statins, ACE inhibitors/ARB, β-blockers, calcium channel 
blockers, and diuretics). Not smoking (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-0.83) and active exercise 
(HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.90) were independently associated 
with lower risks of future events in CAD patients after PCI.
Regarding the joint effects of a healthy lifestyle, the risk of 
future events decreased gradually as the number of healthy 
lifestyle factors increased, and all three healthy lifestyle factors 
were associated with a maximum risk reduction of 38% for 
future adverse events (HR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.20-0.72) (Fig. 2). 
The subgroup analysis showed that the benefits of combined 
modifiable healthy lifestyle factors are especially pronounced 
in younger patients, males, patients with HDL <40 mg/dL, 
those reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 50%), 
and those receiving statin therapy. These findings indicate that 
adherence to a healthy lifestyle was associated with lower risk 
of future coronary heart disease in high-risk CAD patients 
(Fig. 3A and B).
4. DISCUSSION
The major findings of the present study show that adherence to 
healthy lifestyle factors, especially not smoking and active physi-
cal activity, could be associated with significantly decreased risk 
of future cardiovascular events in an Asian cohort of stable CAD 
patients after PCI. Furthermore, the risk decreased as the num-
ber of healthy lifestyle factors increased. Additionally, inflam-
matory markers, waist circumference, LDL cholesterol, and the 
ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol gradually decreased 
as the number of healthy lifestyle factors increased.
These findings showed a dose-dependent beneficial effect of 
combined healthy lifestyle factors in secondary prevention for 
CAD. The subgroup analysis showed that the benefits of com-
bined modifiable healthy lifestyle factors are especially pro-
nounced in the younger population, males, those with HDL 
<40 mg/dL, those with reduced LVEF, and those receiving statin 
therapy. These results indicate that adherence to a healthy life-
style was associated with lower risk of future coronary heart 
disease in high-risk CAD patients.
Adherence to healthy lifestyles has been suggested to reduce 
clinical risk factors. Intensive lifestyle modification by nurse 
managers with a treatment protocol was examined in the 
COURGE trial. The intervention decreased the proportion of 
smokers (from 23% to 19%), increased physical activity (walk 
≥150 minutes per week from 58% to 66%), increased the rate 
of consuming <7% of calories from saturated fat from 46% to 
80%, and significantly decreased blood pressure and LDL.15 In 
another study in India, a community worker-based intervention 
for adherence to drug and lifestyle changes after acute coronary 
syndrome resulted in improvement of clinical risk markers as 
well (BP, weight, lipid profiles, and BMI).16 Both of these stud-
ies showed that lifestyle modification significantly improved 
clinical parameters that are considered to contribute to adverse 
outcomes.
The current study is just an observational study and not 
an intervention study with a lifestyle-modification proto-
col. Nevertheless, we observed benefits if patients with CAD 
maintained recommended healthy lifestyles (healthier diet, 
not smoking, and actively exercise). Similarly, Booth et al17 
observed that adherence to healthy lifestyles (especially smok-
ing cessation, physical activity, and Mediterranean diet) was 
associated with a lower risk of recurrent CHD and death 
in patients after MI, PCI, and CABG. The present not only 
showed an association between lower risk of future adverse 
outcomes and maintaining healthy lifestyle, but also an asso-
ciation between increasing healthy behaviors and improve-
ment of clinical risk factors and inflammatory markers. These 
results provide evidence linking lifestyle modification and 
benefits of CV risk reduction.Table 3

CVD is the leading cause of death in developed countries, and 
many treatment strategies have been suggested to reduce future 
events. Among the different treatment strategies, a healthy life-
style has been encouraged for all patients, but the benefits are 
not easy to assess because of uncertainties regarding compli-
ance. The EUROASPIRE IV study revealed that a large num-
ber of patients with coronary heart disease do not follow the 
guidelines for secondary prevention and have a high prevalence 
of persistent smoking, unhealthy diets, and physical inactivity.18
Our findings showed that greater lifestyle benefits with regard 
to CVD risk came from not smoking and exercise rather than 
from diet. Although a healthy diet was not found to be inde-
pendently associated with reduced risk of adverse events, the 
three combined HLDs, including a healthy diet, still showed the 
maximum risk reduction of 50% when these three factors were 
all present. Interestingly, nearly all clinical trials from the 1960s 
through to the 1980s that examined diets with low total fat, low 
saturated fat, low dietary cholesterol, and increased polyunsatu-
rated fat found significantly decreased serum cholesterol levels 
but failed to document a decrease in cardiovascular events.19,20 
This finding calls into question the importance of dietary con-
trol. However, recent studies on Mediterranean-style diets, 
which are characterized by vegetables, fruit, fish, whole grains, and olive oil, have shown that this approach reduces cardiovas-
cular events to a greater degree than low-fat diets with benefits 
equal to or greater than statin therapies.21 This suggests that a 
Mediterranean-style diet is helpful for secondary prevention in 
CAD patients.
Our observations showed that active physical activity was 
independently associated with a 32% risk reduction after con-
sidering comorbidities, disease severity, and medications, thus 
supporting the benefit of active physical activity for secondary 
prevention. Although there was strong evidence showing an 
inverse dose-response relationship between physical activity and 
mortality, the evidence for patients with preexisting CAD was 
still limited. Recently, Jeong et al22 reported a benefit of physi-
cal activity on mortality reduction in an Asian population and 
showed that individuals with CVD may benefit from physical 
activity to a greater extent than healthy subjects without CVD. 
All of their findings supported that there is benefit in high-risk 
populations.
The association between nonsmoking and future risk fol-
lowed the same trends. Among the three lifestyle factors, not 
smoking provided the highest risk reduction for patients with 
pre-existing CAD in the present study. The benefit is not limited 
to cardiovascular death: large-scale cohort studies have reported Table 4

that smoking is related to deaths from various types of cancer, 
diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and pneumo-
nia.23 Furthermore, the most important finding is that the risk 
declined as the number of years since quitting smoking increased 
among former smokers. This attests to the importance of smok-
ing cessation, especially among high-risk CAD patients.
Our results demonstrated a joint effect of lifestyle modifica-
tion, with the greatest risk reduction occurring in patients with 
high risk. This finding is in concordance with recent studies showing that CVD risk is inversely associated with the number 
of healthy behavior changes adopted by diabetic patients24 and a 
Chinese population.3 Our results supported the beneficial effects 
of healthy behaviors on cardiovascular risk reduction1,25 for sec-
ondary prevention among CAD patients receiving PCI and fur -

smoking, and lack of exercise may have significantly attenuated 
risk for MI or death.27 In addition, the current findings further 
showed that serum triglycerides and the ratio of total choles-
terol to HDL cholesterol decreased gradually as the number of 
healthy lifestyle factors increased (p < 0.05). This finding sug-
gests an association between a healthy lifestyle and favorable 
lipid profiles.
Accordingly, a healthy lifestyle may be critical for baseline 
inflammation status and cardiovascular risk factors in either 
primary or secondary cohorts. Even when considering lipid 
profiles, medications, and inflammatory makers, lifestyle modi-
fication was still independently associated with a lower risk of 
future adverse events. Therefore, efforts to improve cardiovascu-
lar risk factors by adopting a healthy lifestyle could be essential 
for secondary prevention in all CAD patients for both Asian and 
Western people.
Our study has several limitations. First, a study nurse con-
firmed the adherence to lifestyle factors, especially dietary information, during the follow-up period. The diet components 
were not consumed in isolation, and multiple interacting food 
components and the consistency of adherence may have affected 
the dietary benefits for secondary prevention. Furthermore, 
the Western dietary recommendations were not designed for 
Taiwanese people.
Second, because the adherence to a healthy lifestyle was 
not randomized, a causal relationship between a healthy life-
style and CVD risk cannot be established. Third, a healthy life-
style and smoking cessation may change an individual’s body 
weight. Although our study did not record body weight during 
each clinic visit, a recent study reported that smoking cessation 
was accompanied by substantial weight gain. Increasing body 
weight after smoking cessation increases the risk of type 2 dia-
betes, which peaks 5 to 7 years after quitting smoking and then 
gradually decreases.28 However, the weight gain did not increase 
the mortality risk and did not mitigate the benefits of quitting 
smoking on reducing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.28Table 5

The definition of regular exercise was modified from one sug-
gestion of 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity. The defi-
nition may not represent all activities, and there is no consensus, 
especially for Asian CAD populations. Finally, the current study 
was an observational cohort study, not an intervention study. 
Thus, a rehabilitation program was not included, and the impact 
of cardiac rehabilitation was not estimated.The evidence suggests that adherence to a healthy lifestyle, 
especially a healthy diet and not smoking, was associated with 
significantly reduced risk of future cardiovascular events in sta-
ble CAD patients. Furthermore, biomedical and inflammatory 
serum profiles were negatively correlated with an increased num-
ber of healthy lifestyle factors. Accordingly, a healthy lifestyle, 
even in the presence of standard medication, could be critical for

ies should be conducted to refine the potential role of lifestyle

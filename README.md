# Medical Research Relevancy Tool

A tool that uses AI to suggest a relevant set of medical papers to a user based on their data (medical history, physical characteristics, demographics, etc.) without sending user data to a model. 

## Design

### Key Considerations

- **Privacy**: No user data leaves the systemâ€”the matching engine runs locally using inputs from the AI and user data, which never touches the model.
- **Cost**: Each uploaded paper makes 3 API calls to OpenAI, which can then be tested against any number of user profiles.
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB's flexible schema and document-oriented storage allow for easy adaptation to changing data requirements and efficient management of complex, nested user profile data.

### Technologies

#### <u>Frontend</u>
- React 18
- Material-UI (MUI)
- React Router
- Axios

#### <u>Backend</u>
- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Motor (MongoDB driver)
- OpenAI API
- PyPDF2

#### <u>Database</u>
- MongoDB

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- MongoDB
- pip
- npm

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-research-relevancy-tool.git
   cd medical-research-relevancy-tool
   ```

2. **Set up the Backend**

   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```

   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - Set up environment variables:
     - Create a `.env` file in the `src` directory and add your environment variables, namely `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `MONGODB_URL`.

3. **Set up the Frontend**

   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

   - Install the required Node packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start MongoDB**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running on your system.

2. **Start the Backend Server**

   From the root directory:
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.api.app:app --reload
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Start the Frontend Development Server**

   In a new terminal, from the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Additional Information
The <i>sample_papers</i> directory contains a set of papers that may be used to test the tool.
